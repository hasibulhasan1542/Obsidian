### **Part I: Solved Answers**

**1. (a) State zeroth, first and second laws of thermodynamics. Name the three distinct properties which are obtained from the zeroth law, first law and second law of thermodynamics. (6 Marks)**

*   **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics:** States that if two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third one, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
    *   **Property Obtained:** **Temperature (T)**. The Zeroth Law provides the basis for measuring temperature.

*   **First Law of Thermodynamics:** This is the law of conservation of energy. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. For a closed system undergoing a cycle, the net heat transfer is equal to the net work transfer (∮δQ = ∮δW). For a process, the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system (ΔU = Q - W).
    *   **Property Obtained:** **Internal Energy (U)**. The First Law defines internal energy as a property of the system.

*   **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** This law defines the direction of thermodynamic processes and the concept of entropy. It can be stated in two common ways:
    *   **Kelvin-Planck Statement:** It is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no other effect than the production of work and the exchange of heat with a single reservoir. (i.e., no heat engine can be 100% efficient).
    *   **Clausius Statement:** It is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no other effect than the transfer of heat from a lower-temperature body to a higher-temperature body. (i.e., heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold to hot).
    *   **Property Obtained:** **Entropy (S)**. The Second Law leads to the definition of entropy, a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system.

**1. (b) Describe the working principle of an open cycle gas turbine with suitable diagram. (9 Marks)**

An open cycle gas turbine operates on the principles of the **Brayton Cycle**. It is an internal combustion engine where the working fluid (air) is continuously drawn from the atmosphere and exhausted back to it.

**Working Principle:**
The cycle consists of four main processes:
1.  **Isentropic Compression:** Atmospheric air is drawn into a **compressor**, where its pressure and temperature are significantly increased.
2.  **Constant Pressure Heat Addition:** The high-pressure air then flows into a **combustion chamber**. Here, fuel is injected and burned, adding heat to the air at constant pressure, which drastically increases its temperature and enthalpy.
3.  **Isentropic Expansion:** The hot, high-pressure gas from the combustion chamber expands through a **turbine**. This expansion process produces mechanical work. A portion of this work is used to drive the compressor, and the remaining net work is the useful power output of the engine (e.g., to drive a generator).
4.  **Constant Pressure Heat Rejection:** The expanded gases are exhausted from the turbine into the atmosphere. In an open cycle, this step is implicit as the hot exhaust is simply released.

**1. (c) A heat engine outputs 100 MW of power while burning 20,000 litres of fuel per hour. The fuel has a heating value of 44,000 kJ/litre. Determine the thermal efficiency of the engine. (5 Marks)**

**Given:**
*   Power Output (Work_out) = 100 MW = 100 x 10⁶ J/s
*   Fuel consumption rate = 20,000 L/hr
*   Heating Value (HV) of fuel = 44,000 kJ/L = 44 x 10⁶ J/L

**1. Calculate the Heat Input Rate (Q_in):**
First, convert the fuel consumption rate from L/hr to L/s.
Fuel rate = 20,000 L / 3600 s ≈ 5.556 L/s

Now, calculate the heat input rate:
Q_in = Fuel rate × Heating Value
Q_in = 5.556 L/s × 44 x 10⁶ J/L
Q_in ≈ 244,444,444 J/s = 244.44 MW

**2. Calculate the Thermal Efficiency (η_th):**
Thermal efficiency is the ratio of the power output to the heat input.
η_th = Work_out / Q_in
η_th = (100 x 10⁶ J/s) / (244.44 x 10⁶ J/s)
η_th = 0.409

To express as a percentage:
η_th = 0.409 × 100% = 40.9%

**Answer:** The thermal efficiency of the heat engine is approximately **40.9%**.

**2. (a) How is thermocouple principle used for cooling and heating the substance? (5 Marks)**

The principle used for cooling and heating is the **Peltier Effect**, which is closely related to the **Seebeck Effect** (the basis of thermocouple temperature measurement).

*   **Peltier Effect:** When a direct current (DC) is passed through a junction of two dissimilar conductors (like in a thermocouple), heat is either absorbed or released at the junction, depending on the direction of the current.
    *   **Cooling:** If current flows in a direction that causes heat to be absorbed from the surroundings at the junction, this junction becomes cold. This is the principle behind thermoelectric coolers (TECs) or Peltier modules.
    *   **Heating:** If the direction of the current is reversed, the same junction will release heat, causing it to become hot.

**Application:** A Peltier device is constructed with many P-type and N-type semiconductor elements connected in series electrically and in parallel thermally. When a DC voltage is applied, one side of the device gets cold (absorbing heat) and the other side gets hot (rejecting heat). By controlling the direction and magnitude of the current, one can achieve both cooling and heating from the same device.

**2. (b) What are the differences between boiler mountings and boiler accessories? (4 Marks)**

| Feature | Boiler Mountings | Boiler Accessories |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Essential for the safe and controlled operation of the boiler. | Used to improve the performance and efficiency of the boiler. |
| **Requirement** | Mandatory. They are required by boiler regulations and safety laws. | Optional. They are not essential for basic operation but are added for economic reasons. |
| **Location** | Typically mounted directly on the boiler shell. | Generally installed as part of the boiler system, but often external to the main shell (e.g., in the flue gas path). |
| **Function** | Primarily for safety and monitoring. | Primarily for efficiency enhancement and pre-processing. |
| **Examples** | Safety valves, Pressure gauge, Water level indicator, Fusible plug, Steam stop valve. | Economizer, Superheater, Air pre-heater, Feed pump. |

**2. (c) What is a heat recovery steam generator? Draw the block diagram of a gas turbine HRSG combined cycle thermal power plant. (11 Marks)**

A **Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG)** is a type of heat exchanger that recovers waste heat from a hot gas stream (typically the exhaust from a gas turbine) and uses it to produce steam. This steam can then be used to drive a steam turbine, for process heating, or other applications. The primary purpose of an HRSG is to improve the overall thermal efficiency of the power plant.

**Gas Turbine HRSG Combined Cycle:**
This is a highly efficient power generation system that combines a **Brayton Cycle (Gas Turbine)** and a **Rankine Cycle (Steam Turbine)**. The waste heat from the gas turbine is used as the heat source for the steam turbine via an HRSG.

```
**Working Explanation:**
1.  The **Gas Turbine** burns fuel to produce mechanical power and hot exhaust gases.
2.  The hot exhaust gases, instead of being wasted, are directed into the **HRSG**.
3.  In the HRSG, the heat from the exhaust gases boils water to produce high-pressure steam. The cooled exhaust is then released through a stack.
4.  The steam produced in the HRSG is sent to a **Steam Turbine**, which expands the steam to produce additional mechanical power.
5.  Both the gas turbine and the steam turbine are connected to generators to produce electricity. By utilizing the waste heat, a combined cycle plant can achieve thermal efficiencies well over 50-60%, which is significantly higher than either cycle operating alone.

Of course. Here are the detailed model answers for questions 3 and 4 from Part I of the exam.

### **Question 3**

**(a) Define ‘one ton’ of refrigeration. Calculate how much heat is equivalent to ‘one ton’. (3 Marks)**

**Definition:**
One ton of refrigeration (TOR) is a unit of power used to describe the heat-extraction capacity of a refrigeration or air conditioning system. It is defined as the rate of heat transfer required to produce 1 US ton (2000 pounds or 907.2 kg) of ice at 0°C from water at 0°C in a period of 24 hours.

**Calculation:**
The latent heat of fusion of ice (the heat that must be removed to freeze water into ice) is approximately:
*   144 BTU per pound (BTU/lb)
*   334 kJ per kilogram (kJ/kg)

**Calculation in Standard Units (kW):**
1.  Total heat to be removed in 24 hours = 2000 lb × 144 BTU/lb = 288,000 BTU.
2.  Heat removal rate = 288,000 BTU / 24 hours = 12,000 BTU/hr.
3.  This is often expressed in minutes: 12,000 BTU/hr ÷ 60 min/hr = **200 BTU/min**.

To convert this to SI units (kW, which is kJ/s):
*   1 BTU = 1.055 kJ
*   1 hour = 3600 seconds

Rate (in kW) = (12,000 BTU/hr) × (1.055 kJ/BTU) / (3600 s/hr)
Rate ≈ 12660 / 3600 kJ/s ≈ **3.517 kJ/s** or **3.517 kW**.

**Answer:** One ton of refrigeration is equivalent to a heat removal rate of **3.517 kW**.

**(b) Discuss the most desired properties of a refrigerant. (5 Marks)**

A refrigerant is the working fluid in a refrigeration cycle. Its properties are critical for the system's efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. The most desired properties are:

**1. Thermodynamic Properties:**
*   **High Latent Heat of Vaporization:** A large amount of heat is absorbed when the refrigerant evaporates. This means a smaller mass of refrigerant is needed to achieve the desired cooling effect, allowing for smaller components.
*   **Low Boiling Point:** The refrigerant must have a boiling point below the target temperature of the refrigerated space at atmospheric pressure.
*   **Moderate Condenser and Evaporator Pressures:** The evaporator pressure should be slightly above atmospheric pressure to prevent air and moisture from leaking into the system. The condenser pressure should not be excessively high, as this would require stronger, heavier, and more expensive pipes and components.
*   **High Critical Temperature:** The critical temperature should be well above the maximum temperature the refrigerant will experience in the condenser to ensure it can be easily liquefied.

**2. Safety and Environmental Properties:**
*   **Non-toxic and Non-flammable:** For safety, especially in domestic and commercial applications, the refrigerant should not be poisonous or pose a fire hazard in case of a leak.
*   **Zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP):** The refrigerant should not damage the Earth's ozone layer. This has led to the phasing out of CFCs (like R-12).
*   **Low Global Warming Potential (GWP):** The refrigerant should have a minimal contribution to the greenhouse effect. This is a major focus of modern refrigerant development.

**3. Physical and Chemical Properties:**
*   **Chemically Stable:** It should not decompose or react chemically within the operating temperature and pressure range.
*   **Non-corrosive:** It must not corrode the materials of the compressor, pipes, and other components.
*   **Low Viscosity and High Thermal Conductivity:** Low viscosity reduces the power required for pumping, and high thermal conductivity improves heat transfer efficiency in the evaporator and condenser.
*   **Low Cost and Easy Availability:** The refrigerant should be inexpensive and readily available for initial charging and servicing.

**(c) List the main components of a central air-conditioning system and show them in a block diagram illustrating the cooling process. (12 Marks)**

**Main Components:**
A central air-conditioning system is typically a vapor-compression system integrated with an air handling system. The main components can be grouped as follows:

*   **Refrigerant Cycle Components:**
    1.  **Compressor:** Compresses the low-pressure refrigerant vapor into a high-pressure, high-temperature vapor.
    2.  **Condenser:** Rejects heat from the refrigerant to an external medium (air or water), causing it to condense into a high-pressure liquid.
    3.  **Expansion Valve (Throttling Device):** Reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid refrigerant.
    4.  **Evaporator (Cooling Coil):** Absorbs heat from the air passing over it, causing the low-pressure liquid refrigerant to boil and become a vapor. This is where the air is cooled.

*   **Air Handling and Distribution Components:**
    5.  **Air Handling Unit (AHU):** An enclosure containing the blower, cooling coil (evaporator), filters, and dampers.
    6.  **Blower/Fan:** Circulates air through the ductwork.
    7.  **Ductwork:** A network of ducts that distributes the cooled air to various spaces (supply ducts) and brings warm air back to the AHU (return ducts).
    8.  **Filters:** To clean the air by removing dust and other particles.

**Block Diagram of a Central Air-Conditioning System:**

The diagram shows two interconnected loops: the **Refrigerant Loop** (in blue) and the **Air Loop** (in red/orange).

```

**Process Explanation:**
1.  Warm air from the conditioned space is drawn through the return duct and mixed with some fresh outside air.
2.  This air passes through filters and then over the **Evaporator/Cooling Coil**.
3.  Inside the coil, the low-pressure refrigerant absorbs heat from the air and boils. The air, having lost its heat, becomes cool.
4.  The now cool air is pushed by the **Blower** through the supply ducts back into the space.
5.  The refrigerant, now a low-pressure vapor, is drawn into the **Compressor**, where its pressure and temperature are increased.
6.  The high-pressure, hot refrigerant gas flows to the **Condenser**, where it releases its heat to the outside air and condenses back into a liquid.
7.  This high-pressure liquid then passes through the **Expansion Valve**, where its pressure drops, and it becomes a cold, low-pressure mixture, ready to enter the evaporator again and repeat the cycle.

### **Question 4**

**(a) Define gauge, absolute and vacuum pressure. How would you deduce the absolute pressure from gauge and vacuum pressure? (6 Marks)**

**Definitions:**
*   **Absolute Pressure (P_abs):** This is the true pressure measured relative to a perfect vacuum (absolute zero pressure). It is the total pressure exerted by a fluid.
*   **Gauge Pressure (P_gauge):** This is the pressure measured relative to the local atmospheric pressure. It is the pressure that standard gauges read. Gauge pressure can be positive (above atmospheric) or negative (below atmospheric).
*   **Vacuum Pressure (P_vac):** This is a type of negative gauge pressure. It is defined as the pressure *below* the local atmospheric pressure. It is the difference between atmospheric pressure and the absolute pressure.

**Deducing Absolute Pressure:**
The relationship between these pressures can be expressed with simple formulas:

1.  **For Gauge Pressure:** Absolute pressure is the sum of gauge pressure and atmospheric pressure.
    **`P_absolute = P_gauge + P_atmospheric`**

2.  **For Vacuum Pressure:** Absolute pressure is the atmospheric pressure minus the vacuum pressure.
    **`P_absolute = P_atmospheric - P_vacuum`**

**Diagrammatic Representation:**
```

**(b) Differentiate between piezometer and manometer. Why is the inclined manometer used? (6 Marks)**

**Differentiation:**

| Feature | Piezometer | Manometer (U-Tube) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Construction** | A simple, single vertical tube, open to the atmosphere at the top. | A U-shaped tube containing a manometric fluid (e.g., mercury) that is immiscible with and denser than the fluid being measured. |
| **Application** | Measures moderate, positive gauge pressures of **liquids only**. | Measures positive, negative (vacuum), and differential pressures of both **liquids and gases**. |
| **Limitations** | - Cannot measure gas pressure.<br>- Cannot measure vacuum pressure.<br>- Impractical for high pressures (requires a very long tube). | Can handle a wide range of pressures depending on the manometric fluid used. More versatile and widely applicable. |
| **Principle** | Pressure is determined by the height the liquid rises in the tube (`P = ρgh`). | Pressure is determined by the difference in the levels of the manometric fluid in the two limbs. |

**Why an Inclined Manometer is Used:**
An inclined manometer is used for the precise measurement of **very small pressure differences**.

The reason for its high sensitivity lies in its geometry. In a standard U-tube manometer, the pressure is related to the vertical height difference (`h`). For a very small pressure, `h` is also very small and difficult to read accurately.

In an inclined manometer, the reading tube is tilted at an angle `θ` to the horizontal. The fluid moves a distance `L` along the tube. The relationship between the vertical height `h` and the inclined length `L` is:
`h = L * sin(θ)`

Therefore, the length reading is:
`L = h / sin(θ)`

Since `sin(θ)` is always less than 1 (for `θ` < 90°), the length `L` read along the tube is much larger than the actual vertical height `h`. This **magnifies the reading**, making it possible to measure tiny pressure changes with high accuracy. For example, if `θ = 10°`, then `sin(10°) ≈ 0.174`, so `L ≈ 5.7 * h`. A 1 mm vertical change would show up as a 5.7 mm change along the tube.

**(c) Air flows through a 30m long horizontal rectangular duct having dimensions 3m by 2m. The velocity of air through the duct is 6m/s. Determine the pressure drop in the duct. Given, friction factor f=0.02. (8 Marks)**

**1. Identify Formula and Parameters:**
The pressure drop due to friction in a duct is calculated using the **Darcy-Weisbach equation**:
`ΔP = f * (L / D_h) * (ρ * v² / 2)`

Where:
*   `ΔP` = Pressure drop (Pa)
*   `f` = Darcy friction factor = 0.02 (given)
*   `L` = Length of the duct = 30 m (given)
*   `D_h` = Hydraulic diameter of the duct (m)
*   `ρ` = Density of the fluid (air) (kg/m³)
*   `v` = Velocity of the fluid = 6 m/s (given)

**2. State Assumptions:**
The density of air (`ρ`) is not given. We will assume standard atmospheric conditions.
*   **Assume Air Density, `ρ` ≈ 1.225 kg/m³** (standard density at sea level, 15°C).

**3. Calculate the Hydraulic Diameter (D_h):**
For a non-circular duct, the hydraulic diameter is used. The formula is:
`D_h = 4 * A / P`
Where `A` is the cross-sectional area and `P` is the wetted perimeter.

*   Area, `A = width × height = 3 m × 2 m = 6 m²`
*   Wetted Perimeter, `P = 2 * (width + height) = 2 * (3 m + 2 m) = 10 m`

Now, calculate `D_h`:
`D_h = (4 * 6 m²) / 10 m = 24 / 10 = 2.4 m`

**4. Calculate the Pressure Drop (ΔP):**
Now substitute all the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:
`ΔP = 0.02 * (30 / 2.4) * (1.225 * 6² / 2)`

`ΔP = 0.02 * (12.5) * (1.225 * 36 / 2)`

`ΔP = 0.25 * (1.225 * 18)`

`ΔP = 0.25 * 22.05`

`ΔP = 5.5125 Pa`

**Answer:** The pressure drop in the duct is **5.51 Pa**.

Excellent. Here are the detailed model answers for questions 5 and 6 from Part I of the exam.

### **Question 5**

**(a) Derive Euler's equation of motion. (8 Marks)**

Euler's equation of motion describes fluid flow by relating pressure change, velocity change, and elevation change for an **ideal fluid** (inviscid and incompressible) in **steady flow**. It is derived by applying Newton's Second Law of Motion (`F = ma`) to a small fluid element moving along a streamline.

**Assumptions:**
1.  The fluid is ideal (non-viscous).
2.  The flow is steady (fluid properties do not change with time at any point).
3.  The flow is incompressible (density `ρ` is constant).
4.  The equation is applied along a single streamline.

**Derivation:**
Consider a small cylindrical fluid element of cross-sectional area `dA` and length `ds` moving along a streamline.



The forces acting on the fluid element in the direction of flow (`s`) are:
1.  **Pressure Force on the upstream face:** `F_p1 = P * dA`
2.  **Pressure Force on the downstream face:** `F_p2 = (P + dP) * dA` (acting in the opposite direction)
3.  **Component of Gravity Force (Weight) along the streamline:** `F_g = dW * sin(θ)` (acting in the opposite direction)

The net force (`F_net`) on the element is:
`F_net = P*dA - (P + dP)*dA - dW*sin(θ)`
`F_net = -dP*dA - dW*sin(θ)`  **(1)**

The weight of the element `dW` is:
`dW = mass * g = (ρ * volume) * g = (ρ * dA * ds) * g`

From the geometry, `sin(θ) = dz/ds`, where `dz` is the change in vertical elevation over length `ds`.
Substituting these into equation (1):
`F_net = -dP*dA - (ρ * dA * ds * g) * (dz/ds)`
`F_net = -dP*dA - ρg*dA*dz` **(2)**

According to Newton's Second Law, `F_net = mass * acceleration (a)`.
*   Mass `m = ρ * dA * ds`
*   Acceleration `a = dv/dt`. Since the flow is steady, velocity `v` is a function of position `s`, not time `t`. Using the chain rule:
    `a = dv/dt = (dv/ds) * (ds/dt) = v * (dv/ds)`

So, the force due to acceleration is:
`F_net = (ρ * dA * ds) * (v * dv/ds) = ρ*dA*v*dv` **(3)**

Now, equate the force equations (2) and (3):
`-dP*dA - ρg*dA*dz = ρ*dA*v*dv`

Divide the entire equation by `dA`:
`-dP - ρg*dz = ρv*dv`

Rearrange the terms to have all terms on one side:
`dP + ρv*dv + ρg*dz = 0`

Divide by density `ρ` to get the most common form:
**`(dP/ρ) + v*dv + g*dz = 0`**

This is **Euler's equation of motion**. Integrating this equation along a streamline gives Bernoulli's equation.

**(b) What is the difference between a venturimeter and orifice meter? (4 Marks)**

| Feature | Venturimeter | Orifice Meter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Construction** | A short converging cone, a throat, and a long diverging cone. It is a single, integrated unit. | A simple, thin circular plate with a sharp-edged, concentric hole (orifice) clamped between two pipe flanges. |
| **Energy Loss** | Very low head loss (typically 10-20% of the differential pressure) due to the gradual diverging cone which allows for efficient pressure recovery. | High permanent head loss (typically 40-90% of the differential pressure) due to the sudden expansion of the fluid jet downstream, causing significant turbulence. |
| **Cost & Size** | Bulky, heavy, and expensive to manufacture and install. | Compact, simple, and inexpensive. Easy to install. |
| **Coefficient of Discharge (Cd)** | High, typically in the range of **0.95 to 0.98**. | Lower, typically in the range of **0.60 to 0.65**. |

**(c) Describe the ways to prevent ‘knock’ in SI engines. (8 Marks)**

**Engine knock (or detonation)** is the uncontrolled, explosive combustion of the unburned air-fuel mixture (end-gas) ahead of the normal flame front. It is caused by the end-gas reaching its auto-ignition temperature and pressure. It leads to a sharp pressure spike, potential engine damage, and reduced efficiency.

Ways to prevent knock focus on either making the fuel more resistant to auto-ignition or reducing the temperature and pressure of the end-gas.

1.  **Increase Fuel Octane Rating:** This is the most direct method. A higher octane number indicates a fuel's greater resistance to auto-ignition. Using fuel with the manufacturer-recommended octane rating is crucial.

2.  **Retard Ignition Timing:** Initiating the spark later in the compression stroke (i.e., less spark advance) reduces the time the end-gas is exposed to high temperatures and pressures before the flame front arrives, thus preventing auto-ignition. Modern Engine Control Units (ECUs) use knock sensors to dynamically retard timing when knock is detected.

3.  **Lower the Compression Ratio:** Knock is highly sensitive to the compression ratio. A lower compression ratio results in lower temperature and pressure of the mixture at the end of the compression stroke, reducing the likelihood of knock. This comes at the cost of reduced thermal efficiency.

4.  **Enrich the Air-Fuel Mixture:** A slightly richer mixture (more fuel than stoichiometric) has a cooling effect due to the higher latent heat of vaporization of the extra fuel. This helps keep the end-gas temperature below its auto-ignition point.

5.  **Improve Combustion Chamber Design:** A compact combustion chamber with a central spark plug location reduces the flame travel distance and time. This ensures the entire mixture is burned by the flame front before the end-gas has time to auto-ignite. Turbulent chamber designs also speed up combustion.

6.  **Enhance Engine Cooling:** A more effective cooling system removes heat from the cylinder head and walls, which in turn cools the end-gas, making it less prone to knocking.

7.  **Reduce Engine Load:** At high loads, more air-fuel mixture is inducted, leading to higher cylinder pressures and a greater tendency to knock. Reducing the throttle opening lowers the cylinder pressure.

8.  **Use Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR):** Introducing a small amount of inert exhaust gas into the intake mixture increases the specific heat of the charge and slows down combustion, which lowers the peak combustion temperature and pressure, thereby suppressing knock.

### **Question 6**

**(a) Differentiate between a turbo-charger and a super-charger. (4 Marks)**

Both are forced induction devices that compress intake air to increase engine power, but they differ fundamentally in their power source.

| Feature | Turbo-charger | Super-charger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power Source** | Driven by the kinetic energy of the engine's **exhaust gases**, which spin a turbine connected to a compressor. | Driven **mechanically** by the engine's crankshaft, typically via a belt, gear, or chain drive. |
| **Efficiency** | More efficient, as it utilizes waste energy from the exhaust. It does not create significant parasitic load on the engine. | Less efficient, as it draws power directly from the crankshaft, creating a **parasitic load** on the engine. |
| **Response Time** | Suffers from **"turbo lag"**—a delay in boost response at low RPMs because exhaust flow is insufficient to spin the turbine quickly. | Provides **instantaneous boost** that is directly proportional to engine RPM, as it is mechanically linked. |
| **Operating Heat** | Operates at extremely high temperatures due to its connection to the exhaust manifold. Often requires an intercooler. | Operates at much lower temperatures. |

**(b) What is ‘spark advance’ in an SI engine? What happens to output peak pressure (maximum torque), output power, knock, pollutant exhaust, etc. of an SI engine when spark is (i) over-advanced, (ii) properly-advanced and (iii) retarded? (10 Marks)**

**Spark Advance:**
Spark advance is the timing of the spark plug firing relative to the piston's position. It is measured in degrees of crankshaft rotation **Before Top Dead Center (BTDC)**. Since combustion takes a finite amount of time, the spark must be initiated before the piston reaches TDC to ensure that peak cylinder pressure occurs at the optimal point in the power stroke (typically 15-20° After TDC), thus maximizing the work done on the piston.

**(ii) Properly-Advanced (Optimal Timing or MBT - Maximum Brake Torque):**
*   **Process:** The spark is timed perfectly so that the peak combustion pressure occurs at the ideal crankshaft angle during the power stroke.
*   **Peak Pressure:** Occurs at the optimal point for work extraction (~15-20° ATDC).
*   **Torque & Power:** **Maximum**. The engine produces its highest possible torque and power for the given conditions.
*   **Knock:** The risk of knock is managed and kept at a minimum, just below the knock limit.
*   **Pollutants:** Emissions are controlled within the engine's designed parameters.

**(i) Over-Advanced (Too much advance):**
*   **Process:** The spark fires too early. Significant pressure builds while the piston is still on its compression stroke, working against the piston's upward motion.
*   **Peak Pressure:** Increases significantly and occurs too early (closer to TDC or even before). This creates negative work.
*   **Torque & Power:** **Decreases**. The engine is fighting against its own combustion pressure.
*   **Knock:** **High risk of severe knock**. The end-gas is exposed to high pressure and temperature for a prolonged period, making auto-ignition very likely.
*   **Pollutants:** The extremely high in-cylinder temperatures lead to a sharp increase in **NOx (Nitrogen Oxides)** formation.

**(iii) Retarded (Too little advance):**
*   **Process:** The spark fires too late (close to or after TDC). The piston is already well into its power stroke, and cylinder volume has increased significantly before combustion pressure peaks.
*   **Peak Pressure:** **Decreases** and occurs too late in the power stroke.
*   **Torque & Power:** **Decreases significantly**. Much of the fuel's energy is not converted into useful work and is lost as heat in the exhaust.
*   **Knock:** **Risk of knock is very low**. This is often done intentionally by engine controllers to prevent knock under high load.
*   **Pollutants:** Incomplete combustion can increase **HC (Hydrocarbon)** emissions. The **Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) increases dramatically**, which can damage the exhaust manifold, turbocharger, and catalytic converter.

**(c) A four-stroke four-cylinder diesel engine has a compression ratio of 17, a clearance volume of 31.25 cc and develops 55kW at 3600 rpm. Calculate the displacement volume and its mean effective pressure. (6 Marks)**

**Given:**
*   Number of cylinders, `k = 4`
*   Compression Ratio, `CR = 17`
*   Clearance Volume (per cylinder), `Vc = 31.25 cc = 31.25 x 10⁻⁶ m³`
*   Power, `P = 55 kW = 55,000 W`
*   Speed, `N = 3600 rpm`
*   Engine type: 4-stroke

**1. Calculate Displacement Volume (Vd):**
The compression ratio is given by: `CR = (Vd + Vc) / Vc`
Rearranging for the displacement volume (`Vd`):
`Vd = Vc * (CR - 1)`
`Vd = 31.25 cc * (17 - 1)`
`Vd = 31.25 * 16`
`Vd = 500 cc` (This is the displacement volume for one cylinder).

**Total Displacement Volume (Vd_total):**
`Vd_total = Vd * k = 500 cc/cyl * 4 cyl = 2000 cc`
Converting to cubic meters:
`Vd_total = 2000 cm³ = 2000 * (10⁻² m)³ = 2000 * 10⁻⁶ m³ = 0.002 m³`

**2. Calculate Mean Effective Pressure (MEP):**
The formula for the power of a four-stroke engine is:
`P = (MEP * Vd_total * N) / (2 * 60)`
*(The '2' in the denominator is because a 4-stroke engine completes one power cycle in two revolutions).*

Rearranging the formula to solve for MEP:
`MEP = (P * 2 * 60) / (Vd_total * N)`

Substitute the given values:
`MEP = (55,000 W * 120) / (0.002 m³ * 3600 rpm)`
`MEP = 6,600,000 / 7.2`
`MEP = 916,666.67 Pa`

To express this in more common units:
*   In kilopascals (kPa): `MEP = 916.67 kPa`
*   In bar (1 bar = 10⁵ Pa): `MEP = 9.17 bar`

**Answer:**
*   The displacement volume (per cylinder) is **500 cc**. The total engine displacement is **2000 cc**.
*   The mean effective pressure (MEP) is **916.67 kPa** or **9.17 bar**.

***

Of course. Here are the detailed model answers for question 7 from Part I of the exam.

### **Question 7**

**(a) Write down Bernoulli's equation and list the assumptions made in the equation. (6 Marks)**

**Bernoulli's Equation:**
Bernoulli's equation represents the principle of conservation of energy for an ideal fluid in steady flow. It states that for any two points along a streamline, the total energy per unit weight of the fluid remains constant. The equation is typically written in terms of "head":

`P / (ρg) + v² / (2g) + z = Constant`

Where:
*   `P` = Pressure of the fluid
*   `ρ` = Density of the fluid
*   `g` = Acceleration due to gravity
*   `v` = Velocity of the fluid
*   `z` = Elevation head (height above a reference datum)

Each term represents a form of energy per unit weight:
*   `P / (ρg)` is the **Pressure Head**.
*   `v² / (2g)` is the **Velocity Head** (or kinetic head).
*   `z` is the **Potential Head** (or elevation head).

**Assumptions for Bernoulli's Equation:**
The equation is a simplification and relies on several key assumptions:
1.  **The fluid is ideal (inviscid):** The fluid is assumed to have zero viscosity. This means there are no frictional losses (energy loss due to shear forces) as the fluid moves.
2.  **The flow is steady:** The fluid properties (such as velocity, pressure, and density) at any point in the flow do not change with time.
3.  **The flow is incompressible:** The density of the fluid (`ρ`) is assumed to be constant throughout the flow. This is a valid assumption for most liquids but less so for gases undergoing large pressure changes.
4.  **The flow is along a streamline:** The equation is strictly valid when applied to points that lie on the same streamline.
5.  **No external energy transfer:** No heat is added to or removed from the fluid, and no work is done on or by the fluid (e.g., by a pump or turbine) between the two points being analyzed.

**(b) Why is air vessel used in a reciprocating pump? (4 Marks)**

An air vessel is a closed chamber containing compressed air, fitted to the suction and/or delivery pipe of a reciprocating pump. Its primary purpose is to convert the pulsating, intermittent flow from the pump's piston into a nearly steady, continuous flow in the pipes.

This is necessary to solve several problems caused by the pulsating flow:

1.  **To Reduce Acceleration Head:** In a reciprocating pump, the entire column of water in the pipe must be accelerated from rest at the beginning of a stroke and brought to rest at the end. This requires a large force, creating a significant **acceleration head**. This head can cause the pressure on the suction side to drop low enough for **cavitation** to occur and can cause the liquid column to separate from the piston on the delivery side. The air vessel absorbs the pulsating flow, meaning the water in the pipe beyond the vessel flows at a nearly constant velocity, drastically reducing the acceleration head.

2.  **To Save Power:** By reducing the maximum pressure the pump has to work against (by smoothing out the pressure peaks caused by acceleration), the air vessel significantly reduces the power required to run the pump.

3.  **To Allow Higher Pump Speeds:** With the risk of cavitation and separation minimized, the pump can be operated at a much higher speed, increasing its discharge rate without causing damage.

4.  **To Obtain a Uniform Flow Rate:** The air vessel acts as a buffer. On the delivery side, when the piston moves fastest, it delivers excess water into the vessel, compressing the air. When the piston slows down, the compressed air pushes this stored water out, ensuring a continuous and uniform flow into the delivery pipe.

**(c) A centrifugal pump delivers 30 litres of water per second against a head of 12m and running at 1450 rpm requires 6.0 hp. Determine the discharge, head of the pump and power required if the pump runs at 1800 rpm. (10 Marks)**

This problem is solved using the **Pump Affinity Laws**, which describe how the performance of a centrifugal pump changes with its rotational speed (`N`), provided the impeller diameter remains constant.

**Given:**
*   Initial Speed, `N₁ = 1450 rpm`
*   Initial Discharge, `Q₁ = 30 L/s`
*   Initial Head, `H₁ = 12 m`
*   Initial Power, `P₁ = 6.0 hp`
*   New Speed, `N₂ = 1800 rpm`

**The Affinity Laws:**
1.  Discharge is proportional to speed: `Q₂ / Q₁ = N₂ / N₁`
2.  Head is proportional to the square of the speed: `H₂ / H₁ = (N₂ / N₁)²`
3.  Power is proportional to the cube of the speed: `P₂ / P₁ = (N₂ / N₁)³`

**Step 1: Calculate the Speed Ratio**
`Speed Ratio = N₂ / N₁ = 1800 / 1450 ≈ 1.2414`

**Step 2: Determine the New Discharge (Q₂)**
Using the first affinity law:
`Q₂ = Q₁ * (N₂ / N₁)`
`Q₂ = 30 L/s * 1.2414`
`Q₂ ≈ 37.24 L/s`

**Step 3: Determine the New Head (H₂)**
Using the second affinity law:
`H₂ = H₁ * (N₂ / N₁)²`
`H₂ = 12 m * (1.2414)²`
`H₂ = 12 m * 1.541`
`H₂ ≈ 18.49 m`

**Step 4: Determine the New Power Required (P₂)**
Using the third affinity law:
`P₂ = P₁ * (N₂ / N₁)³`
`P₂ = 6.0 hp * (1.2414)³`
`P₂ = 6.0 hp * 1.913`
`P₂ ≈ 11.48 hp`

**Final Answer:**
If the pump speed is increased to 1800 rpm:
*   The new discharge will be approximately **37.24 L/s**.
*   The new head will be approximately **18.49 m**.
*   The new power required will be approximately **11.48 hp**.

Of course. Here are the detailed solutions for questions 8 and 9 from Part II of the exam.

### **Question 8**

**(a) Define stress, Young's modulus, modulus of toughness and modulus of resilience. (8 Marks)**

*   **Stress (σ):** Stress is the measure of the internal resisting force exerted by the particles of a body per unit of its cross-sectional area in response to an external force. It quantifies the intensity of internal forces.
    *   **Formula:** `σ = F / A` (where F is the internal resisting force and A is the area).
    *   **Units:** Pascals (Pa) or N/m².
    *   **Significance:** It describes how a load is distributed within a material.

*   **Young's Modulus (E):** Also known as the Modulus of Elasticity, it is a measure of a material's stiffness. It is defined as the ratio of tensile or compressive stress to the corresponding strain within the elastic limit (the region where the material returns to its original shape after the load is removed).
    *   **Formula:** `E = Stress (σ) / Strain (ε)`
    *   **Significance:** A high value of E indicates a stiff material that deforms very little under load (e.g., steel), while a low value indicates a flexible material (e.g., rubber).

*   **Modulus of Resilience (Ur):** This represents the ability of a material to absorb energy when deformed elastically and to release that energy upon unloading. It is defined as the strain energy stored per unit volume of the material up to the elastic limit.
    *   **Representation:** It is the area under the stress-strain curve from the origin up to the yield point.
    *   **Significance:** It is a measure of the "springiness" of a material. Materials with high resilience are used for springs.

*   **Modulus of Toughness (Ut):** This represents the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform before fracturing. It is defined as the total strain energy absorbed per unit volume of the material up to the point of fracture.
    *   **Representation:** It is the total area under the entire stress-strain curve.
    *   **Significance:** Toughness is a crucial property for components that may be subjected to impact or shock loads, as it indicates the ability to withstand such loads without breaking.

**(b) What are principal plane and principal stress? (4 Marks)**

*   **Principal Plane:** At any point within a stressed body, there exist three mutually perpendicular planes on which the shear stresses are zero. These specific planes are known as **principal planes**.

*   **Principal Stress:** The normal stress (either tensile or compressive) that acts on a principal plane is known as a **principal stress**. Since there is no shear stress on these planes, the principal stresses represent the maximum and minimum normal stresses experienced by that point in the material. They are often denoted as σ₁, σ₂, and σ₃.

**(c) A simply supported beam with a gradually varying load from zero at B and 50 N/m at A is shown in the figure below. Draw shear force and bending moment diagram of the beam. What is the shear force at B? (8 Marks)**

**1. Calculate Support Reactions:**
*   The beam is simply supported with length `L = 3 m`.
*   The load is triangular, with max intensity `w₀ = 50 N/m` at A and 0 at B.
*   Total Load (`W`) = Area of the triangle = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 3 m × 50 N/m = **75 N**.
*   The centroid of the triangular load is at a distance of `L/3` from the high end (A). So, the total load acts at `3/3 = 1 m` from A.
*   Take moments about A to find the reaction at B (`R_B`):
    `ΣM_A = 0`
    `R_B × 3 - W × 1 = 0`
    `3 * R_B - 75 * 1 = 0`
    `R_B = 75 / 3 = 25 N`
*   Sum of vertical forces to find the reaction at A (`R_A`):
    `ΣF_y = 0`
    `R_A + R_B - W = 0`
    `R_A + 25 - 75 = 0`
    `R_A = 50 N`

**2. Shear Force Diagram (SFD):**
*   The shear force at A is `V_A = R_A = +50 N`.
*   The shear force at B is `V_B = -R_B = -25 N`.
*   The relationship `dV/dx = -w(x)` shows that the shear diagram will be a parabola since the load `w(x)` is linear.
*   The shear force is zero where the bending moment is maximum. We can find this point `x` from A:
    `V(x) = R_A - Area of load up to x = 50 - (1/2) * (50 + w(x)) * x`
    The load `w(x) = 50 - (50/3)x`. This leads to a quadratic equation. `V(x) = 50 - 50x + (25/3)x²`.
    Setting `V(x) = 0`: `x² - 6x + 6 = 0`. Solving gives `x = 3 - √3 ≈ 1.268 m`.

**3. Bending Moment Diagram (BMD):**
*   The bending moment at supports A and B is zero.
*   The relationship `dM/dx = V(x)` shows that the bending moment diagram will be a cubic curve.
*   The maximum bending moment occurs where `V(x) = 0`, i.e., at `x = 1.268 m`.
*   `M_max = R_A * x - (Moment of load section about x)`
    `M_max = 50(1.268) - [Area of trapezium * centroid]`
    Calculating the moment `M(x) = 50x - 25x² + (25/9)x³`.
    `M_max = M(1.268) ≈ 50(1.268) - 25(1.268)² + (25/9)(1.268)³ ≈ 28.87 N-m`.

**4. Final Diagrams and Answer:**

*   **Shear Force at B:** The shear force just to the left of support B is **-25 N**.

*   **Diagrams:**

### **Question 9**

**(a) What are the mechanical properties of metals which are associated with the ability of the material to resist mechanical forces and load? (6 Marks)**

The primary mechanical properties that describe a material's ability to resist forces and loads are:
1.  **Strength:** The ability of a material to withstand an applied stress without failure.
    *   **Yield Strength:** The stress at which a material begins to deform plastically (permanently).
    *   **Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS):** The maximum stress a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before necking begins.
2.  **Stiffness (Modulus of Elasticity):** The ability to resist elastic (non-permanent) deformation under load. A stiff material deforms very little for a given load.
3.  **Toughness:** The ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform before fracturing. It is critical for resisting impact and shock loads.
4.  **Hardness:** The ability to resist localized plastic deformation, such as scratching, abrasion, or indentation.
5.  **Fatigue Strength (Endurance Limit):** The ability of a material to withstand repeated cycles of loading and unloading (cyclic loading) without failing. This is crucial for components like axles, springs, and bearings.
6.  **Creep Resistance:** The ability of a material to resist slow, continuous deformation under a constant load, especially at elevated temperatures.

**(b) Define and classify cast iron. (6 Marks)**

**Definition:**
Cast iron is a family of iron-carbon alloys with a high carbon content, typically ranging from **2.1% to 4.0% by weight**. It also contains significant amounts of silicon (1-3%) and other minor elements. Its high carbon content gives it a relatively low melting point, excellent fluidity, and good castability, but also makes it more brittle than steel.

**Classification:**
Cast iron is primarily classified based on the form in which the carbon exists in its microstructure, which determines its mechanical properties.

1.  **Grey Cast Iron:** Carbon is present as graphite flakes. This structure gives it excellent machinability and vibration damping capacity but low tensile strength and ductility. Its fracture surface is grey.
2.  **White Cast Iron:** Carbon exists as iron carbide (cementite, Fe₃C), formed by rapid cooling. It is extremely hard, brittle, and wear-resistant. Its fracture surface is bright white.
3.  **Ductile (or Nodular) Cast Iron:** Carbon is present as small spheres or nodules, achieved by adding magnesium or cerium to the molten iron. This shape eliminates the stress concentration points of flakes, giving it higher strength and significant ductility, similar to steel.
4.  **Malleable Cast Iron:** Produced by a prolonged heat treatment (annealing) of white cast iron. This process breaks down the cementite into irregular clusters of graphite (temper carbon). It has better ductility and shock resistance than grey cast iron.
5.  **Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI):** A modern type where the graphite structure is intermediate between the flakes of grey iron and the nodules of ductile iron. It offers a combination of good thermal conductivity, high strength, and better ductility than grey iron.

**(c) A metal pipe of 1m diameter contains a fluid having a pressure 1 N/mm². If the permissible tensile stress in the metal is 20 N/mm², what thickness of the metal is required for making the pipe? (8 Marks)**

This is a thin-walled pressure vessel problem. The critical stress in a pipe under internal pressure is the circumferential stress, also known as **hoop stress (σ_h)**.

**Given:**
*   Internal Diameter, `D = 1 m = 1000 mm`
*   Internal Pressure, `P = 1 N/mm²`
*   Permissible Tensile Stress, `σ_perm = 20 N/mm²`

**Formula for Hoop Stress:**
For a thin-walled cylinder, the hoop stress is given by:
`σ_h = (P * D) / (2 * t)`
where `t` is the thickness of the pipe wall.

**Calculation:**
We must ensure that the hoop stress developed in the pipe does not exceed the permissible stress. Therefore, we set `σ_h = σ_perm`.

`σ_perm = (P * D) / (2 * t)`

Now, we rearrange the formula to solve for the required thickness, `t`:
`t = (P * D) / (2 * σ_perm)`

Substitute the given values:
`t = (1 N/mm² * 1000 mm) / (2 * 20 N/mm²)`
`t = 1000 / 40`
`t = 25 mm`

**Check the thin-wall assumption:**
The analysis is valid if `D / t > 20`.
`1000 mm / 25 mm = 40`.
Since `40 > 20`, the thin-walled vessel assumption is valid.

**Answer:** The required thickness of the metal for the pipe is **25 mm**.

***

Of course. Here are the detailed solutions for questions 10 and 11 from Part II of the exam.

### **Question 10**

**(a) What are the symbols used in work study and what are their meanings? (6 Marks)**

In work study, specifically in process charting, a standard set of symbols (ASME symbols) is used to represent different types of activities. These symbols help in visualizing, analyzing, and improving work processes.

The five primary symbols are:

| Symbol | Name | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **O** | **Operation** | An activity that changes the physical or chemical characteristics of an object, assembles or disassembles it, or prepares it for another activity. Examples: Drilling, painting, typing a letter. |
| **☐** | **Inspection** | An activity that verifies the quality or quantity of an object against a standard. It does not add value but ensures conformity. Examples: Checking dimensions, proofreading a document. |
| **→** | **Transportation** | An activity that involves the movement of an object, worker, or material from one location to another. Examples: Moving parts to an assembly line, carrying a file to another office. |
| **D** | **Delay** | A temporary stoppage in the process where an object or worker is waiting for the next planned action. This is an unplanned wait. Examples: A part waiting for a machine to become free, a document waiting in an 'in-tray'. |
| **▽** | **Storage** | A planned stoppage where an object is kept and protected against unauthorized removal. Examples: Finished goods in a warehouse, raw materials in a storeroom. |

**(b) Discuss routing, scheduling and dispatching in brief. (6 Marks)**

Routing, Scheduling, and Dispatching are three sequential and critical functions within Production Planning and Control (PPC).

1.  **Routing:** This is the first step and determines the **path** that raw materials will follow to become a finished product. It specifies the sequence of operations to be performed, identifies the machines, tools, and workstations to be used for each operation, and sets the standard time for each step. Essentially, routing defines the "how," "what with," and "where" of the production process.

2.  **Scheduling:** Following routing, scheduling determines the **timeline** for production. It assigns start and end times for each operation on each machine. The goal is to optimize the use of resources (machines, labor) and ensure that production orders are completed by their due dates. It answers the "when" question in production. Common tools include Gantt charts and master production schedules.

3.  **Dispatching:** This is the action phase of PPC. Dispatching involves the release of work orders and instructions from the planning department to the shop floor, authorizing the start of production activities as per the routing and scheduling plans. This includes issuing drawings, material requisitions, tool orders, and other necessary paperwork to initiate the work. It is the "go" signal that sets the plans in motion.

**(c) In the network shown in the figure below, draw the critical path: (8 Marks)**
*(Image description: A network diagram with nodes 1 through 9 and various activity paths, including dummy activities.)*

**Understanding the Problem:**
The critical path is the longest duration path through a network diagram. It determines the shortest possible time in which the entire project can be completed. Any delay in an activity on the critical path will directly delay the completion of the entire project.

**Method to find the Critical Path:**
1.  Identify all possible paths from the start node (1) to the end node (9).
2.  Calculate the total duration of each path by summing the time taken for each activity along that path.
3.  The path with the longest total duration is the critical path.

**Analysis of the Provided Diagram:**
The provided network diagram is incomplete for a standard critical path analysis because **it does not include the durations for any of the activities** (the numbers that should be associated with each arrow). Without these durations, it is **impossible to mathematically determine the longest path**.

**Explanation of the Process (Assuming Durations were given):**
To solve this, one would first list all valid paths from node 1 to node 9, respecting the precedence of the dummy activities (dashed lines). The main paths appear to be:
*   **Path A:** 1 → 2 → 4 → 7 → 8 → 9
*   **Path B:** 1 → 2 → 5 → 7 → 8 → 9
*   **Path C:** 1 → 3 → 5 → 7 → 8 → 9
*   **Path D:** 1 → 3 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9
    *(Note: The dummy activities (e.g., 4→5, 6→4) create further dependencies that must be considered when calculating earliest start times for each node, but the fundamental paths remain as above.)*

If durations (t) were provided for each activity (e.g., t₁₂, t₂₄, etc.), you would calculate:
*   Duration of Path A = t₁₂ + t₂₄ + t₄₇ + t₇₈ + t₈₉
*   Duration of Path B = t₁₂ + t₂₅ + t₅₇ + t₇₈ + t₈₉
*   ...and so on for all other paths.

The path with the maximum calculated sum would be the critical path.

**Conclusion:**
Since the required activity durations are missing from the diagram, the critical path cannot be determined. The solution requires data that is not provided in the question.

### **Question 11**

**(a) Compare belt, rope, chain and shaft drive as media of power transmission. (7 Marks)**

| Feature | Belt Drive | Rope Drive | Chain Drive | Shaft Drive |

| **Lubrication** | Not required. | Not required. | Essential for reducing wear and friction. | Bearings and gears require lubrication. |
| **Application** | Conveyors, flour mills, machine tools (e.g., lathes). | Lifts, cranes, elevators, haulage systems. | Bicycles, motorcycles, industrial machinery. | Automotive driveshafts, gearbox outputs, power tools. |

**(b) Distinguish the usage of the (i) spur gear, (ii) helical gear, (iii) bevel gear, (iv) worm gear, (v) rack and pinion, (vi) idle gear and (vii) planetary gear. (7 Marks)**

*   **(i) Spur Gear:** Used to transmit power between two **parallel shafts**. They are the simplest and most common type of gear, used in applications like clocks, washing machines, and general industrial machinery where high speeds or low noise are not critical.
*   **(ii) Helical Gear:** Used to transmit power between two **parallel shafts**. The teeth are cut at an angle, allowing for gradual engagement. This results in smoother, quieter operation and higher load-carrying capacity than spur gears. Used in automotive gearboxes.
*   **(iii) Bevel Gear:** Used to transmit power between two **intersecting shafts** (typically at 90°). They have a cone shape. Used in vehicle differentials and hand drills.
*   **(iv) Worm Gear:** Used to transmit power between two **non-intersecting, non-parallel shafts** (typically perpendicular). They provide a very high speed reduction ratio in a compact space and are often self-locking. Used in conveyor systems and machine tool indexing heads.
*   **(v) Rack and Pinion:** Used to convert **rotational motion into linear motion** (or vice versa). The pinion is a standard spur gear, and the rack is a straight, toothed bar. Used in automotive steering systems and lathe machine beds.
*   **(vi) Idle Gear:** An intermediate gear placed between a driver gear and a driven gear. Its purpose is to **reverse the direction of rotation** of the driven gear without changing the overall speed ratio.
*   **(vii) Planetary Gear (Epicyclic Gear Train):** A complex system consisting of a central 'sun' gear, 'planet' gears rotating around it, and an outer 'ring' gear. It is used to achieve high speed reductions and high torque transmission in a very compact space. Used in automatic transmissions and electric screwdrivers.

**(c) Find the power transmitted by a belt running over a pulley of 600mm diameter at 200 rpm. The coefficient of friction between the belt and the pulley is 0.25, angle of lap 160° and maximum tension in the belt is 2500N. (6 Marks)**

**1. List Given Data and Convert Units:**
*   Maximum Tension (Tight Side), `T₁ = 2500 N`
*   Diameter of pulley, `D = 600 mm = 0.6 m`
*   Speed of pulley, `N = 200 rpm`
*   Coefficient of friction, `μ = 0.25`
*   Angle of lap, `θ = 160°`. **This must be converted to radians.**
    `θ_rad = 160° * (π / 180°) ≈ 2.7925 radians`

**2. Calculate the Belt Velocity (v):**
The velocity of the belt is given by the formula:
`v = (π * D * N) / 60`
`v = (π * 0.6 m * 200 rpm) / 60`
`v ≈ 6.283 m/s`

**3. Calculate the Tension in the Slack Side (T₂):**
The relationship between the tight side and slack side tensions is given by the belt friction equation:
`T₁ / T₂ = e^(μθ)`
where `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.

`2500 / T₂ = e^(0.25 * 2.7925)`
`2500 / T₂ = e^(0.6981)`
`2500 / T₂ ≈ 2.01`
`T₂ = 2500 / 2.01 ≈ 1243.8 N`

**4. Calculate the Power Transmitted (P):**
The power transmitted by the belt is the product of the net tension and the belt velocity:
`P = (T₁ - T₂) * v`
`P = (2500 N - 1243.8 N) * 6.283 m/s`
`P = (1256.2 N) * 6.283 m/s`
`P ≈ 7892.4 Watts`

To express this in kilowatts (kW):
`P = 7892.4 / 1000 = 7.89 kW`

**Answer:** The power transmitted by the belt is approximately **7.89 kW**.

***

Of course. Here are the detailed solutions for questions 12 and 13 from Part II of the exam.

### **Question 12**

**(a) What are the most common casting defects? Discuss briefly. (7 Marks)**

Casting defects are imperfections in a cast product that can compromise its quality, appearance, or functionality. They arise from issues in the casting process, mold design, or metal properties. The most common defects include:

1.  **Gas Porosity (Blowholes):** These are small, spherical cavities caused by gases trapped within the molten metal as it solidifies.
    *   **Cause:** Moisture in the molding sand turning to steam, dissolved gases in the molten metal coming out of solution during cooling, or poor venting of the mold cavity.

2.  **Shrinkage Defects (Cavities):** These are voids or depressions that form because most metals shrink (reduce in volume) as they cool and solidify.
    *   **Cause:** Improper design of the riser (the reservoir of molten metal that feeds the casting as it shrinks). If the riser solidifies before the main casting, a shrinkage cavity will form in the casting itself.

3.  **Misrun and Cold Shut:**
    *   **Misrun:** A defect where the molten metal fails to completely fill the mold cavity, resulting in an incomplete casting.
    *   **Cold Shut:** Occurs when two streams of molten metal meet but fail to fuse together properly, creating a weak spot or crack.
    *   **Cause:** Low pouring temperature, lack of fluidity in the metal, or a poorly designed gating system that restricts flow.

4.  **Inclusions:** These are particles of non-metallic material, such as sand, slag, or oxides, trapped within the casting.
    *   **Cause:** Erosion of the mold or core material, turbulent pouring that traps slag, or impurities in the molten metal. Inclusions create stress concentrations and weaken the casting.

5.  **Hot Tears (Hot Cracking):** These are cracks that form in the casting while it is still hot and weak, just after solidification.
    *   **Cause:** The mold or core restricts the casting's natural contraction during cooling, inducing tensile stresses that tear the weak metal apart.

6.  **Mismatch:** This occurs when the top half (cope) and bottom half (drag) of the mold are not properly aligned, causing a step or displacement in the final casting at the parting line.

**(b) What are the basic differences between ‘hot working’ and ‘cold working’ in the metal works? (5 Marks)**

Hot working and cold working are two fundamental categories of metal forming processes, distinguished by the temperature at which they are performed relative to the material's recrystallization temperature.

| Feature | Hot Working | Cold Working |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temperature** | Performed **above** the metal's recrystallization temperature. | Performed **below** the metal's recrystallization temperature (often at room temp). |
| **Effect on Microstructure** | The deformed grains recrystallize, resulting in a fine, equiaxed grain structure. The material does not strain harden. | The material undergoes strain hardening (work hardening). Grains become distorted and elongated in the direction of working. |
| **Mechanical Properties** | Strength and hardness are not significantly increased. Ductility is maintained. | Strength and hardness are significantly increased. Ductility is reduced. |
| **Forces Required** | Lower forces and less power are required to deform the metal. | Higher forces and more power are required. |
| **Surface Finish & Accuracy** | Poor surface finish due to oxidation and scaling. Lower dimensional accuracy. | Excellent surface finish and high dimensional accuracy. |
| **Residual Stresses** | Minimal or no residual stresses are left in the material. | Significant internal residual stresses are induced. |

**(c) Explain TIG and MIG welding processes mentioning important applications of each. (8 Marks)**

**1. TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) Welding / GTAW (Gas Tungsten Arc Welding):**

*   **Process Explanation:** TIG welding uses a **non-consumable tungsten electrode** to create an electric arc with the workpiece. The intense heat from the arc melts the base metal. The weld pool is protected from atmospheric contamination by an inert **shielding gas** (typically Argon or Helium) fed through the welding torch. If filler material is required, a separate filler rod is fed into the weld pool manually.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   Produces exceptionally high-quality, clean, and precise welds.
    *   Offers excellent control over the weld pool, making it ideal for thin materials.
    *   No slag or spatter is produced.
    *   It is a slower and more skillful process compared to MIG welding.
*   **Important Applications:**
    *   **Aerospace Industry:** For welding critical components made of aluminum, magnesium, and titanium.
    *   **Stainless Steel Fabrication:** For high-purity applications like food processing equipment, pharmaceutical vessels, and architectural features.
    *   **Piping and Tubing:** Especially in nuclear power plants and chemical industries where weld integrity is paramount.
    *   **Automotive:** For custom fabrication and repair of exotic metal components.

**2. MIG (Metal Inert Gas) Welding / GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding):**

*   **Process Explanation:** MIG welding uses a **consumable wire electrode** that is continuously fed through the welding gun from a spool. This wire acts as both the electrode to create the arc and the filler material to form the weld. Similar to TIG, a shielding gas (which can be inert like Argon, or active like CO₂, or a mix) protects the weld pool from contamination.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   High welding speed and high deposition rate (more metal can be deposited quickly).
    *   Easier to learn and can be easily automated for mass production.
    *   Can be used to weld a wide range of material thicknesses, from thin sheets to heavy plates.
    *   Less clean than TIG, may produce some spatter.
*   **Important Applications:**
    *   **Automotive Manufacturing:** For assembly line production of vehicle frames and bodies.
    *   **General Fabrication and Structural Steel:** For manufacturing machinery, building structures, and general repairs.
    *   **Shipbuilding and Pressure Vessels:** Where long, continuous welds on thick steel plates are required.
    *   **Manufacturing:** For a wide variety of industrial and consumer goods.

### **Question 13**

**(a) Explain with neat sketches free vibration and force vibration. (6 Marks)**

*   **Free Vibration:** This occurs when a system is displaced from its equilibrium position and then allowed to vibrate on its own without any external driving force. The system vibrates at its own **natural frequency**. In real-world systems, damping (e.g., air resistance, internal friction) will cause the amplitude of the vibration to decrease over time until it stops.
    **Sketch:**
    

*   **Forced Vibration:** This occurs when a system is subjected to a continuous, time-varying external force. The system is forced to vibrate at the **frequency of the external force** (the driving frequency). The amplitude of the vibration remains constant in the steady state. If the driving frequency is close to the system's natural frequency, a phenomenon called **resonance** occurs, leading to dangerously large amplitudes.
    **Sketch:**
    

**(b) Describe chip formation in metal cutting. (8 Marks)**

Chip formation in metal cutting is a process of severe plastic deformation and shearing. When a cutting tool advances into a workpiece, it exerts a high compressive force, causing the material ahead of the tool to shear off and form a chip.

**The Mechanism:**
1.  **Compression:** The cutting edge of the tool compresses the material of the workpiece.
2.  **Plastic Deformation:** As the stress exceeds the material's elastic limit, it begins to deform plastically in a localized region ahead of the tool tip known as the **primary shear zone**.
3.  **Shearing:** The deformation continues until the ultimate shear strength of the material is exceeded along a plane called the **shear plane**. The material then fails in shear, and a segment of metal (the chip) slides up the tool's face (the rake face).
4.  **Chip Flow:** The newly formed chip flows up the rake face. Friction between the chip and the tool creates a **secondary shear zone**, generating additional heat.

**Types of Chips:**
The characteristics of the chip formed depend on the workpiece material, cutting speed, depth of cut, and tool geometry.

1.  **Continuous Chip:** A long, smooth, continuous ribbon.
    *   **Formation:** Occurs when cutting **ductile materials** (e.g., mild steel, aluminum) at high speeds with a sharp tool.
    *   **Characteristics:** Leads to a good surface finish but can be hazardous due to its long, sharp nature.
2.  **Discontinuous Chip:** The chip breaks into small, separate segments.
    *   **Formation:** Occurs when cutting **brittle materials** (e.g., cast iron) or ductile materials at very low speeds or with high friction.
    *   **Characteristics:** Easier to handle and dispose of, but can lead to a poorer surface finish.
3.  **Continuous Chip with Built-Up Edge (BUE):** A continuous chip with fragments of workpiece material welded to the tool tip.
    *   **Formation:** Occurs when cutting ductile materials at medium speeds. High friction and pressure cause layers of material to adhere to the tool face, forming a "built-up edge." This BUE periodically breaks off and is carried away with the chip or embeds in the workpiece.
    *   **Characteristics:** Results in a poor, rough surface finish.

**(c) What is meant by beam deflection? What are the possible methods of determining beam deflections? (6 Marks)**

**Meaning of Beam Deflection:**
Beam deflection is the vertical displacement of a point on the neutral axis of a beam from its original, unloaded position when subjected to transverse (perpendicular) loads. The shape of the deflected beam is known as the **elastic curve**. Deflection is a critical measure of a beam's stiffness and is important for ensuring the serviceability and integrity of a structure. Excessive deflection can be aesthetically displeasing, cause damage to attached non-structural elements (like plaster or windows), and affect the proper functioning of machinery.

**Methods of Determining Beam Deflection:**
There are several analytical and numerical methods to calculate the deflection of a beam:

1.  **Double Integration Method:** This is a direct method that involves integrating the bending moment equation `M(x) = EI * d²y/dx²` twice to find the equation for the elastic curve `y(x)`. Boundary conditions (at supports) are used to find the constants of integration.
2.  **Macaulay's Method (Singularity Functions):** An extension of the double integration method that uses a single continuous equation to describe the bending moment for beams with multiple point loads or discontinuous loads, simplifying the integration process.
3.  **Moment-Area Method:** A semi-graphical method that uses the properties of the `M/EI` (bending moment divided by flexural rigidity) diagram to determine the slope and deflection at specific points on the beam.
4.  **Conjugate Beam Method:** An analogy-based method where an imaginary "conjugate beam" is loaded with the `M/EI` diagram of the real beam. The shear and moment in the conjugate beam correspond to the slope and deflection of the real beam, respectively.
5.  **Method of Superposition:** This method is used for complex loading conditions. The complex load is broken down into several simpler load cases for which the deflection formulas are already known. The total deflection is then found by algebraically summing the deflections from each individual case.
6.  **Strain Energy Methods (e.g., Castigliano's Theorem):** These methods are based on the principle of conservation of energy. They relate the deflection at a point to the partial derivative of the total strain energy stored in the beam with respect to a force applied at that point.

### **Question 14**

**Write short notes (any four): (5x4=20)**

**(i) Control Charts**

A control chart is a fundamental statistical process control (SPC) tool used to monitor a process over time. It is a graph that displays process data in time order, with statistically determined upper and lower control limits and a centerline.

*   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of a control chart is to distinguish between **common cause variation** (the natural, inherent variability of a process that is in a state of statistical control) and **special cause variation** (unexpected variation resulting from specific, identifiable causes).
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Centerline (CL):** Represents the average or mean of the process data.
    *   **Upper Control Limit (UCL):** Typically set at +3 standard deviations from the centerline.
    *   **Lower Control Limit (LCL):** Typically set at -3 standard deviations from the centerline.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   If all data points fall randomly between the UCL and LCL, the process is considered **"in control."**
    *   If a point falls outside the control limits, or if there is a non-random pattern of points (e.g., seven consecutive points all above or below the centerline), it signals a **"special cause"** is present. This indicates that the process is unstable and requires investigation to identify and correct the root cause of the variation.
*   **Types:** There are different types of control charts for different types of data, such as X-bar and R charts for variable data (measurements) and p-charts or c-charts for attribute data (counts of defects).

**(ii) Management Information System (MIS)**

A Management Information System (MIS) is a computer-based system that provides managers with the tools to organize, evaluate, and efficiently manage departments within an organization. It is designed to synthesize data from various sources to provide information in a structured format that supports managerial decision-making.

*   **Components:** An MIS typically consists of hardware, software, data (both internal and external), procedures, and the people who manage and use the system.
*   **Function:** It is not just about collecting data; it's about processing that data into useful information. It automates the collection and management of data and generates various types of reports:
    *   **Summary Reports:** Aggregate data to show trends (e.g., monthly sales figures).
    *   **Exception Reports:** Highlight deviations from planned performance or standards (e.g., a list of products that are over budget).
    *   **On-demand Reports:** Allow managers to query the system for specific information as needed.
*   **Purpose:** The ultimate goal of an MIS is to improve the performance of an organization by improving the quality of managerial decisions. It helps in strategic planning, problem-solving, and day-to-day operational control by providing timely, accurate, and relevant information.

**(iii) Share and Debenture**

Share and Debenture are two primary financial instruments used by companies to raise long-term capital, but they represent fundamentally different forms of financing.

*   **Share (or Stock):**
    *   **Nature:** Represents **ownership** or equity in a company. A person who holds shares is a shareholder and a part-owner of the company.
    *   **Return:** Shareholders receive a return in the form of **dividends**, which are a portion of the company's profits. Dividends are not guaranteed and depend on the company's profitability and policies.
    *   **Risk:** Shareholders bear the highest risk. In case of liquidation, they are paid last, after all creditors.
    *   **Control:** Shareholders typically have voting rights, allowing them to participate in major company decisions.

*   **Debenture:**
    *   **Nature:** Represents a **loan** or debt to the company. A person who holds a debenture is a creditor of the company.
    *   **Return:** Debenture holders receive a fixed rate of **interest** on their investment, which must be paid by the company regardless of its profitability.
    *   **Risk:** Debenture holders bear lower risk compared to shareholders. They are paid before shareholders in the event of liquidation. Debentures can be secured (backed by company assets) or unsecured.
    *   **Control:** Debenture holders have no voting rights and do not participate in the management of the company.

| Feature | Share | Debenture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Capital Type** | Owned Capital (Equity) | Borrowed Capital (Debt) |
| **Holder Status** | Owner (Shareholder) | Creditor |
| **Return** | Dividend (Variable) | Interest (Fixed) |
| **Security** | Unsecured | Can be secured or unsecured |
| **Control** | Voting rights | No voting rights |

**(iv) Electric Vehicle (EV)**

An Electric Vehicle (EV) is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device.

*   **Key Components:**
    1.  **Battery Pack:** The energy storage system, typically a large lithium-ion battery, that powers the vehicle.
    2.  **Electric Motor:** Converts electrical energy from the battery into mechanical energy to turn the wheels.
    3.  **Inverter:** Converts the direct current (DC) from the battery into alternating current (AC) to run the motor.
    4.  **Onboard Charger:** Converts AC electricity from an external charging source into DC to charge the battery.
    5.  **Controller:** Manages the flow of electrical energy from the battery to the motor, controlling the vehicle's speed and acceleration based on the driver's input.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Zero Tailpipe Emissions:** EVs produce no direct greenhouse gases or pollutants, leading to better air quality.
    *   **Lower Running Costs:** Electricity is generally cheaper than gasoline, and EVs have fewer moving parts, resulting in lower maintenance costs (no oil changes, fewer brake pad replacements due to regenerative braking).
    *   **Quiet and Smooth Operation:** Electric motors provide instant torque, resulting in quick, smooth, and quiet acceleration.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Limited Range and Range Anxiety:** The distance an EV can travel on a single charge is limited, and drivers may worry about running out of power.
    *   **Long Charging Times:** Recharging an EV battery takes significantly longer than refueling a conventional car.
    *   **High Initial Cost:** The purchase price of EVs is typically higher than that of comparable gasoline-powered vehicles.
    *   **Battery Life and Environmental Impact:** The production and disposal of large batteries have environmental and ethical concerns.

**(v) Nuclear Reactor**

A nuclear reactor is a device designed to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. The most common application of nuclear reactors is for the generation of electricity in nuclear power plants.

*   **Principle of Operation:** Nuclear reactors work on the principle of **nuclear fission**. This is the process where the nucleus of a heavy atom, such as **Uranium-235 (U-235)**, splits into smaller parts when it absorbs a neutron. This splitting releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat, as well as two or three additional neutrons. These new neutrons can then go on to cause other U-235 atoms to split, creating a self-sustaining **chain reaction**.
*   **Key Components:**
    1.  **Fuel:** Usually pellets of enriched uranium (U-235) or plutonium.
    2.  **Moderator:** A material (like water, heavy water, or graphite) that slows down the fast-moving neutrons released during fission, making them more likely to be absorbed by other fuel atoms and sustain the chain reaction.
    3.  **Control Rods:** Made of neutron-absorbing materials (like cadmium or boron). They are inserted into or withdrawn from the reactor core to control the rate of the fission reaction (and thus the power output) or to shut it down completely.
    4.  **Coolant:** A fluid (usually water, gas, or liquid metal) that circulates through the reactor core to absorb the heat generated by fission. This hot coolant is then used to produce steam.
    5.  **Containment Structure:** A thick, reinforced concrete and steel structure that encloses the reactor to contain radiation and withstand internal pressure in case of an accident.
*   **Application:** The heat generated by the reactor
