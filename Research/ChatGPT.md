Got it â€” you're facing **two major tasks** at once:

1. **Learn to simulate hydrogen leakage** using an open-source CFD tool like **SU2** or **OpenFOAM**.
    
2. **Learn to process that simulation data with a GNN (Graph Neural Network)** for building a predictive model.
    

And you want to make strong progress within **7 days**.

First, let me be very honest:  
**Mastering** both **CFD simulation** and **GNN modeling** properly in 7 days is **not realistically possible**.  
However, **getting started practically and preparing a "minimum viable" research setup** is **very possible** if you work in a **focused** and **smart** way.

Hereâ€™s a **clear plan** you can follow:

# ðŸ“š Study and Work Details

### CFD Part (OpenFOAM)

- **Focus only on OpenFOAM** (more community examples than SU2 for leakage, multiphase, and mixing).
    
- **Simulation type needed**:
    
    - Likely compressible flow (because hydrogen is very light and fast moving),
        
    - **Species transport** (to model the leak concentration),
        
    - Simple turbulence model (e.g., k-epsilon).
        
- **Tutorial cases to start with**:
    
    - `rhoPisoFoam` or `rhoSimpleFoam` solver for compressible flow.
        
    - `XiFoam` for reactive flow (optional if you think about combustion).
        

### Tools

- **Paraview** to visualize OpenFOAM results easily.
    
- **PyFoam** or manual scripting to export simulation data.
    

---

### GNN Part

- **Libraries**: PyTorch + PyTorch Geometric (PyG).
    
- **Idea**: Treat the CFD mesh (cells/nodes) as a graph:
    
    - Each cell = a node.
        
    - Neighboring cells = edges.
        
    - Features = pressure, temperature, concentration at nodes.
        
    - Label = maybe future concentration values.
        
- **First steps**:
    
    - Learn basic GNN types: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN).
        
    - Learn simple supervised regression using GNN.
        
- **Starter tutorial**: [PyTorch Geometric - Introduction Tutorial](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/introduction.html)

# ðŸ”¥ Important Advice

- **Do not** waste time trying to learn everything theoretically.
    
- **Focus on running** one OpenFOAM simulation successfully, even if itâ€™s crude.
    
- **Focus on implementing** one simple GNN, even if the results are rough.
    
- Treat this as a **first experiment**, not the final product.

# Example First Targets

- **CFD target**: Simulate hydrogen leaking from a small hole in a box.
    
- **GNN target**: Train a GNN to predict the hydrogen concentration in different regions of the box.

Would you like me to also prepare a very **specific "case template" for OpenFOAM** (like a small hydrogen leak example)?  
I can even sketch a **GNN minimal code template** for you too.  
It'll save you hours.
