1. blockMeshDict automatically generates internal and faces patches.
2. So, if simulate something that is inside the box, no need to worry.
3. `inletOutlet` prevents unrealistic temperature spikes during backflow by imposing a physically reasonable value (293 K).
4. for `U` outlet should be 'inletOutlet' type and inletValue '$internalField' and value  '\$internalField' 
5. for `T` outlet should be 'inletOutlet' type and inletValue '$internalField' and value  '\$internalField' 
6. for `p`

In OpenFOAM's **counterflow flame tutorials** (like `counterFlowFlame2D`), the `air` and `fuel` patches are **both inlets**, but they serve distinct roles in the combustion simulation. Here's the key clarification:

---

### **1. Both Are Inlets, But With Different Properties**
| Patch      | Role           | Typical Boundary Conditions                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`air`**  | Oxidizer inlet | - Velocity: `fixedValue` or `flowRateInletVelocity` <br> - Temperature: `fixedValue` (e.g., 300 K) <br> - Species: High `O2` concentration (e.g., 23% mass fraction) |
| **`fuel`** | Fuel inlet     | - Velocity: `fixedValue` or `flowRateInletVelocity` <br> - Temperature: `fixedValue` (e.g., 300 K) <br> - Species: High fuel concentration (e.g., `CH4` for methane) |
# U value meaning

|Patch Role|Boundary Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Wall**|`noSlip`|Velocity = 0 at the wall|
||`slip`|No normal component, but tangential allowed|
||`fixedValue`|Manually specify wall velocity (e.g., moving wall)|
|**Inlet**|`fixedValue`|Set a specific inflow velocity|
|**Outlet**|`zeroGradient`|Let velocity float (Neumann BC)|
|**Freestream**|`pressureInletOutletVelocity`|For far-field or open boundaries with inflow/outflow|
|**Symmetry**|`symmetryPlane`|For symmetry boundaries|

# p_rgh meaning

Great question — in OpenFOAM, **`p_rgh`** is a modified pressure variable that’s commonly used in solvers dealing with **buoyancy**, such as:

- `buoyantSimpleFoam`
- `buoyantPimpleFoam`
- `rhoBuoyantFoam`
- `buoyantReactingFoam`, etc.
