Generate a stl file for me:

There will be 2 box and 2 decagon their dimension and location are below: 
box1 = location (20, 0, 10); dimension (5x10x5) 
box2 = location (70, 0, 20); dimension (4x8x4) 
decagon1= location (30, 0, 17); dimension (r= 3; h=7 {here the height of the decagon will be in y direction}) 
decagon2= location (50, 0, 6); dimension (r= 3; h=10 {here the height of the decagon will be in y direction})
