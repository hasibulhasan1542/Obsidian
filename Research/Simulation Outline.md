For simulating an **H₂ gas leak in a gust situation**, you need to model:

1. **Gas dispersion** — a compressible or weakly compressible gas (H₂),
2. **Buoyancy** — hydrogen is much lighter than air and will rise,
3. **Turbulence** — gust introduces turbulent effects,
4. **Transient behavior** — leaks are time-dependent,
5. **Open environment or partially confined** — optional mesh motion or large domain.

### ✅ Best Solver Choice:

#### **`rhoPimpleFoam`**

- **Why it's suitable:**
    
    - Compressible fluid support (important for H₂, which is light and fast-moving),
    - Turbulent flow modeling using the **PIMPLE** algorithm (PISO + SIMPLE hybrid) — suitable for **transient flows with larger time steps**,
    - Handles **transient gusts** well,
    - Well-supported for environmental leak/discharge simulations.
