I am Hasibul Hasan, currently pursuing a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering, with a growing focus on computational modeling and simulation. I am applying for the Master of Science program in Mechanical Engineering at \[UNIVERSITY NAME\] in France, with the aim of acquiring the advanced technical and professional skills needed to build a career in the French mechanical engineering industry.

My academic background has given me a solid foundation in mechanical engineering principles, especially in areas like thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and materials. During my master’s studies, I expanded this knowledge by working on a research project where I simulated **hydrogen gas leaks using OpenFOAM** and trained a **machine learning-based surrogate model** to predict gas dispersion patterns. This experience taught me not only how to work with industry-grade tools and simulation techniques but also how to solve complex, real-world engineering problems—skills that are directly relevant to the type of work I hope to do professionally.

France’s emphasis on innovation, clean energy, and sustainable manufacturing makes it an ideal place for mechanical engineers. I am particularly drawn to the practical, industry-aligned nature of French engineering programs. The curriculum and applied research focus of \[PROGRAM NAME] at \[UNIVERSITY NAME] matches my goals perfectly, as it provides the right mix of technical depth and real-world problem-solving.

My ultimate objective is to find a position in the French job market where I can apply my simulation, design, and analytical skills in sectors such as energy, manufacturing, or transportation. I am prepared to integrate into a professional environment, adapt to the language and culture, and contribute meaningfully to the engineering challenges faced by French industry.

Studying in France through your program will help me become not just a more capable engineer, but a globally aware one, prepared for the demands of a high-standard workforce. I look forward to learning, growing, and working in a country that values both innovation and quality engineering.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Hasibul Hasan
