### **Topic 1: The Making and Philosophy of the Constitution (The Preamble and Fundamental Principles)**

This is a very common topic for written questions. You need to understand the 'soul' of the Constitution.

**What to Know:**

1.  **Historical Background:** Briefly know the timeline: Constituent Assembly formation (April 1972), Dr. Kamal Hossain as head of the drafting committee, and the rapid adoption of the Constitution on November 4, 1972, coming into effect on December 16, 1972. This speed is a key feature.
2.  **The Preamble:** The Preamble is the mission statement. Memorize the key phrases and understand their meaning:
    *   "We, the people of Bangladesh..." — This establishes **Popular Sovereignty** (the people are the source of all power).
    *   "...having proclaimed our independence on the 26th day of March, 1971..." — Links the Constitution directly to the Liberation War.
    *   "...pledging that the high ideals of nationalism, socialism, democracy and secularism...shall be the fundamental principles of the Constitution." — These are the **four original pillars**.
3.  **Fundamental Principles of State Policy (Part II, Articles 8-25):** This is a high-frequency topic.
    *   **What are they?** These are guiding principles for the state. They are not directly enforceable in court but are fundamental to governance and act as a guide for interpreting laws.
    *   **The Four Pillars (Article 8):** Be able to write a short paragraph on each of the original four principles:
        *   **Nationalism:** Explain that it is **Bengali Nationalism**, based on shared language, culture, and the unity of the Liberation War, not on religion.
        *   **Socialism:** Explain that it means an "exploitation-free society" and "social and economic justice," not state ownership of everything in the communist sense.
        *   **Democracy:** This means a system of representative government where all power belongs to the people.
        *   **Secularism:** Explain that it meant the elimination of communalism and the separation of religion from the state. (You should also be aware of how this principle was amended and later restored).
    *   **Other Important Principles:** Be familiar with Article 11 (Democracy and Human Rights), Article 22 (Separation of Judiciary from Executive), and Article 25 (Foreign Policy: "Friendship to all, malice towards none").

**Potential Question:** "What were the original fundamental principles of the 1972 Constitution? Discuss their significance."

### **Topic 2: Fundamental Rights (Part III, Articles 26-47)**

This is the most critical part for both preliminary and written exams. These rights are the bedrock of citizens' liberty.

**What to Know:**

1.  **The Core Concept:** Fundamental Rights are legally enforceable. If any law is inconsistent with a fundamental right, that law is void **(Article 26)**. The High Court Division can enforce these rights through writ petitions **(Article 102)**.
2.  **Key Rights to Memorize (by Article number and name):**
    *   **Article 27: Equality Before Law.** All citizens are equal before the law.
    *   **Article 28: Prohibition of Discrimination.** No discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. Also contains the clause for **affirmative action** (special provisions for women, children, and backward sections). This is very important.
    *   **Article 31: Right to Protection of Law.** No action detrimental to a person's life, liberty, body, reputation, or property shall be taken except in accordance with the law.
    *   **Article 32: Protection of Right to Life and Personal Liberty.** The cornerstone of personal freedom.
    *   **The "Six Freedoms" (Articles 36-41):** Be able to list them.
        *   Freedom of **Movement** (Art. 36)
        *   Freedom of **Assembly** (Art. 37)
        *   Freedom of **Association** (Art. 38)
        *   Freedom of **Thought, Conscience, and Speech** (Art. 39) - Includes freedom of the press.
        *   Freedom of **Profession or Occupation** (Art. 40)
        *   Freedom of **Religion** (Art. 41)
3.  **Difference between Fundamental Principles and Fundamental Rights:** This is a classic BCS question.
    *   **Enforceability:** Rights are judicially enforceable; Principles are not.
    *   **Nature:** Rights are specific guarantees to citizens against the state; Principles are guidelines for the state to follow.
    *   **Supremacy:** Any law violating a Right is void; Principles cannot invalidate a law.

**Potential Question:** "Make a distinction between the Fundamental Principles of State Policy and the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution of Bangladesh."

### **Topic 3: The Organs of Government (Legislature, Executive, Judiciary)**

This section tests your understanding of the structure of the state and the separation of powers.

**What to Know:**

1.  **The Legislature (Jatiya Sangsad):**
    *   **Composition:** Unicameral, 350 seats (300 directly elected, 50 reserved for women).
    *   **Functions:** Law-making, financial control (passing the budget - the "power of the purse"), and ensuring the accountability of the executive.
    *   **Article 70:** This "anti-floor crossing" provision is a very common topic. Understand its meaning (an MP loses their seat if they vote against their party) and be prepared to discuss its pros (ensures stability) and cons (curbs MPs' freedom of speech).
2.  **The Executive:**
    *   **Structure:** Comprises the President (Head of State) and the Cabinet led by the Prime Minister (Head of Government). Bangladesh has a **parliamentary system**.
    *   **Power Dynamic:** The President's role is largely ceremonial. Real executive power lies with the **Prime Minister and the Cabinet**, who are collectively responsible to the Parliament (Article 55).
3.  **The Judiciary:**
    *   **Structure:** The Supreme Court at the apex, with two divisions: the **Appellate Division** and the **High Court Division**.
    *   **Separation of the Judiciary (Article 22 & Masdar Hossain Case):** Understand the significance of the Masdar Hossain case verdict, which led to the formal separation of the lower judiciary from executive control in 2007.
    *   **Judicial Review (Article 102):** The power of the High Court Division to review the actions of the executive and the laws passed by the legislature to ensure they are consistent with the Constitution. This is the judiciary's most powerful tool for upholding the rule of law.

**Potential Question:** "Explain the concept of Separation of Powers as enshrined in the Constitution of Bangladesh, with reference to the three organs of the state."

### **Topic 4: Key Constitutional Amendments**

You don't need to know all amendments, but some are historically and politically crucial.

**What to Know:**

*   **4th Amendment (1975):** Changed the system from parliamentary to a presidential one-party system (BAKSAL).
*   **5th Amendment (1979):** Legitimized the military government after 1975, removed Secularism and Socialism, and introduced "Bismillah-ar-Rahman-ar-Rahim." (Later declared illegal by the Supreme Court).
*   **8th Amendment (1988):** Made Islam the state religion. (Also a controversial topic).
*   **12th Amendment (1991):** Re-established the parliamentary system of government.
*   **13th Amendment (1996):** Introduced the system of the Non-Party Caretaker Government to oversee elections. (Later declared illegal by the Supreme Court).
*   **15th Amendment (2011):** A major amendment. Key features: abolished the Caretaker Government system, restored Secularism and the other original principles, and made certain basic provisions of the constitution unamendable.

**Potential Question:** "Discuss the significance of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh."

By focusing your study on these four core areas, you will be well-prepared to tackle the majority of questions on the Constitution of Bangladesh that appear in the BCS examinations. Good luck

Of course. Let's do a detailed breakdown of **Topic 3: The Organs of Government**.

This topic is central to understanding how the state of Bangladesh functions. The Constitution establishes a **parliamentary republic**, and this system is defined by the specific powers and interrelationships of the three main organs: the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary. BCS written questions often require you to analyze their roles, functions, and the system of "checks and balances" between them.

### **Detailed Discussion: The Organs of Government (Part V, VI)**

The Constitution of Bangladesh, following the principle of **Separation of Powers**, distributes the functions of the state among three distinct branches. However, in our parliamentary system (also known as the Westminster model), this separation is not absolute; there is a significant fusion, particularly between the legislature and the executive.

### **1. The Legislature (Jatiya Sangsad)**

The Legislature, known as the **Jatiya Sangsad** or House of the Nation, is the supreme law-making body and the physical embodiment of the people's sovereignty.

**A. Composition (Article 65):**
*   **Unicameral:** It is a single-house legislature, unlike bicameral systems (like India or the UK) which have two houses.
*   **Membership:** The Jatiya Sangsad consists of **350 members**.
    *   **300 Members** are directly elected from single-territorial constituencies based on the "first-past-the-post" system (the candidate with the most votes wins).
    *   **50 Seats** are reserved exclusively for women. These members are not directly elected by the public but are elected by the 300 general-seat members based on the proportional representation of parties in parliament.

**B. Core Functions and Powers:**

1.  **Legislative Power (Law-Making):** This is its primary function. It has the authority to make, amend, or repeal any law. A legislative proposal, called a **Bill**, becomes an **Act** (law) after it is passed by a majority vote in the Parliament and receives the assent of the President (Article 80).
2.  **Financial Powers (The "Power of the Purse"):** This is Parliament's most significant power over the executive.
    *   **Budget Approval (Article 87):** The government cannot spend any public money without the approval of the Jatiya Sangsad. The annual budget must be presented to and passed by Parliament.
    *   **Taxation (Article 83):** No tax can be levied or collected except by the authority of an Act of Parliament. This gives the people's representatives direct control over the state's finances.
3.  **Ensuring Executive Accountability:** In a parliamentary system, the government is accountable to the legislature. The Jatiya Sangsad uses several mechanisms to exercise this oversight:
    *   **Question Hour:** MPs can ask ministers questions about the functioning of their ministries.
    *   **Standing Committees:** These are small committees of MPs that scrutinize the work, budget, and bills of specific ministries in detail.
    *   **No-Confidence Motion (Article 55(3)):** The ultimate tool of accountability. The Parliament can pass a vote of no-confidence against the government. If passed, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet must resign.
4.  **Constituent Power (Article 142):** Parliament has the supreme power to amend the Constitution itself, requiring a two-thirds majority of its members.

**C. Article 70 - The "Anti-Floor Crossing" Provision:**
This is a unique and frequently discussed feature. It states that a Member of Parliament will lose their seat if they:
*   Resign from the political party that nominated them.
*   Vote in Parliament against that party.

*   **Argument For (Pros):** It ensures political stability by preventing MPs from being "bought" by other parties, which could topple a government. It strengthens party discipline.
*   **Argument Against (Cons):** It is heavily criticized for stifling the freedom of speech of individual MPs. They cannot vote according to their conscience or the interests of their constituents if it goes against the party line, effectively turning them into voting machines for the party leadership. This weakens Parliament's role as a forum for debate and accountability.

### **2. The Executive**

The Executive branch is responsible for implementing the laws and administering the state.

**A. Composition:**
*   **The President (Head of State, Part IV):** The President is the ceremonial head. He is elected by the members of the Jatiya Sangsad. His role is largely symbolic (e.g., appointing the PM and Chief Justice, giving assent to bills, acting as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces). According to **Article 48(3)**, the President must act in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister in almost all matters.
*   **The Cabinet (The Real Executive, Part IV):** The Cabinet is composed of the **Prime Minister** and other Ministers, Ministers of State, and Deputy Ministers. The **Prime Minister** is the **Head of Government**.

**B. The Parliamentary Executive System (The "Fusion of Powers"):**

1.  **Formation:** The President appoints as Prime Minister the MP who appears to command the confidence of the majority of the members of Parliament (Article 56). The Prime Minister then chooses other ministers, who are also typically MPs.
2.  **Collective Responsibility (Article 55(3)):** This is the cardinal principle of the parliamentary system. The Cabinet is **collectively responsible to the Jatiya Sangsad**. This means the entire Cabinet stands or falls together. If a decision made by one minister is criticized, the entire government must defend it. If the government loses a vote of no-confidence, the entire Cabinet resigns.
3.  **Link with Legislature:** The fact that the Prime Minister and ministers are members of the Parliament is the "fusion" or "link" between the executive and the legislature. The executive is drawn from within the legislature and remains accountable to it.

### **3. The Judiciary**

The Judiciary is the guardian of the Constitution and the ultimate arbiter of law. Its independence is vital for upholding the rule of law.

**A. Structure (Part VI):**
*   **The Supreme Court (Article 94):** The highest court of the land, comprising two divisions:
    *   **The High Court Division:** Has both original jurisdiction (e.g., writ petitions) and appellate jurisdiction over lower courts.
    *   **The Appellate Division:** The highest court of appeal. It hears appeals from the judgments of the High Court Division.
*   **Subordinate Courts:** These are the district courts and other lower courts that handle the vast majority of civil and criminal cases.

**B. Key Powers and Principles:**

1.  **Judicial Independence (Article 94(4)):** The Constitution guarantees that the judiciary shall be independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.
2.  **Separation of the Judiciary from the Executive:** This long-standing constitutional goal (Article 22) was substantially realized in 2007 following the landmark verdict in the **Masdar Hossain Case**. This judgment led to the creation of a separate Judicial Service Commission for the appointment of judges to the subordinate courts and placed their control under the Supreme Court, separating them from the executive branch.
3.  **Power of Judicial Review (Article 102):** This is the judiciary's most profound power and a cornerstone of constitutionalism. The High Court Division has the power to:
    *   Review any law passed by Parliament and declare it **void** if it is found to be inconsistent with the Constitution (especially the Fundamental Rights).
    *   Review any action taken by an executive or public authority and declare it to be "without lawful authority" if it violates the law.
    *   Issue **writs** to enforce the Fundamental Rights of citizens. This power acts as a crucial check on the potential excesses of both the legislature and the executive.

### **Interrelationship and Checks and Balances:**

*   The **Legislature** checks the **Executive** through no-confidence motions and financial control.
*   The **Executive** can check the **Legislature** as the Prime Minister can advise the President to dissolve Parliament.
*   The **Judiciary** checks both the **Legislature** and the **Executive** through the power of Judicial Review.
*   The **Legislature** can check the **Judiciary** through the process of impeaching Supreme Court judges (as per Article 96).

By understanding these roles, powers, and interconnections, you can provide a well-structured and detailed answer to any question on the organs of government in Bangladesh.
