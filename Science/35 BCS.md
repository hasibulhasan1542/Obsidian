### **Part A: General Science**
**Total Marks: 60**
**(Answer any eight questions)**

---

### **Question 1**

**Scenario:** *To make yogurt, Minhaz mixed a small amount of old yogurt as a starter culture into boiled milk in the evening. After some time, when the milk cooled down, he incubated it overnight at a temperature of 37-40°C. The next morning, Minhaz noticed that the milk had not curdled and the desired yogurt was not formed.*

**(a) Write the names of three dairy products produced through biotechnology. (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Three dairy products produced through biotechnology are:
1.  Yogurt
2.  Cheese
3.  Kefir

---

**(b) What is the starter culture mentioned in the scenario? What does it contain? (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
The starter culture mentioned in the scenario is a small amount of existing yogurt (basi doi). It contains millions of live, beneficial bacteria, specifically **lactic acid bacteria** (such as *Lactobacillus* and *Streptococcus* species). These bacteria are essential for fermenting the milk to produce new yogurt.

---

**(c) What is the reason for Minhaz's failure to make yogurt? (1 mark)**

**Answer:**
Minhaz failed because he added the starter culture to the milk while it was still **boiling hot**. The extremely high temperature of the boiling milk killed the live bacteria in the starter culture. Without live bacteria, the fermentation process could not begin, and therefore the milk did not curdle to form yogurt.

---

**(d) Explain the process of milk turning into yogurt. (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
The process of milk turning into yogurt is a biochemical process called **lactic acid fermentation**.
1.  A starter culture containing live lactic acid bacteria is added to warm milk (ideally around 40-45°C).
2.  The bacteria use the sugar present in the milk, called **lactose**, as their food source for energy.
3.  Through fermentation, the bacteria convert the lactose into **lactic acid**.
4.  As lactic acid is produced, the acidity (pH) of the milk decreases.
5.  This increased acidity causes the main protein in milk, **casein**, to denature and coagulate (clump together).
6.  This coagulation process thickens the milk, giving yogurt its characteristic semi-solid texture. The lactic acid also contributes to its tangy flavor.

### **Question 2**

**Scenario:** *With the expansion of modern agricultural methods, the presence of frogs and birds is no longer observed in the agricultural lands of Bangladesh as before. Destruction of habitat and an adverse reproductive environment are the reasons for this.*

**(a) Why is the presence of frogs and birds not observed in agricultural lands as before? Mention the specific reason in each case. (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
The presence of frogs and birds has decreased for the following specific reasons:
*   **Frogs:** The widespread use of **chemical pesticides and herbicides** in modern agriculture is highly toxic to frogs. They absorb these chemicals through their permeable skin, which leads to their death or reproductive failure. Additionally, the draining of wetlands and ponds for farming destroys their habitats.
*   **Birds:** The indiscriminate use of **pesticides** kills the insects that birds feed on, reducing their food source. Some pesticides can also directly poison the birds. Furthermore, deforestation and the clearing of land for agriculture destroy their nesting sites.

---

**(b) Explain how frogs and birds help in an environmentally friendly agricultural system. (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Frogs and birds act as natural pest controllers in an environmentally friendly agricultural system:
*   **Frogs:** They are voracious predators of insects and slugs that damage crops. By consuming these pests, they naturally control pest populations without the need for harmful chemical pesticides.
*   **Birds:** Many species of birds also feed on insects, worms, and other pests that are harmful to crops. Their presence helps maintain a natural balance in the ecosystem and reduces crop damage, promoting a healthier and more sustainable farming environment.

---

**(c) "Harmful chemical substances like DDT are now part of the food chain" - Analyze this comment with specific information. (4 marks)**

**Answer:**
This statement is accurate and describes the phenomenon of **biomagnification**.
1.  **Persistence:** Harmful chemicals like DDT are **persistent organic pollutants (POPs)**. They do not break down easily and remain in the environment for a very long time.
2.  **Entry into the Food Chain:** When DDT is sprayed on crops, it gets into the soil and water. From there, it is absorbed by small organisms like plankton and insects.
3.  **Bioaccumulation:** These small organisms are eaten by larger ones (e.g., small fish). DDT is fat-soluble, so it accumulates in the fatty tissues of these animals rather than being excreted.
4.  **Biomagnification:** As we move up the food chain, each predator consumes many prey, and the concentration of DDT becomes increasingly magnified at each trophic level. A small fish eats many plankton, a larger fish eats many small fish, and a bird of prey eats many large fish.
5.  **Impact on Top Predators and Humans:** Consequently, the highest concentrations of DDT are found in top predators, including humans. This can lead to severe health problems, including cancer, reproductive disorders, and neurological damage, demonstrating how these chemicals have become an integral and dangerous part of our food chain.

### **Question 3**

**Scenario:** *The day after Eid, Rahim Mia found the fish in his pond gasping for air at the surface. Rahim Mia tried to solve this problem by hitting the water surface repeatedly with a long bamboo stick.*

**(a) What is an Algal Bloom? (1 mark)**

**Answer:**
An algal bloom is a rapid and excessive growth of algae in a body of water, often caused by an overabundance of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. This growth can discolor the water and have harmful effects on the ecosystem.

---

**(b) Why were the fish gasping for air? Why did this problem arise? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The fish were gasping for air because of a severe lack of **dissolved oxygen** in the water, a condition known as **hypoxia**.
This problem arose due to **eutrophication**, likely caused by the dumping of sacrificial animal waste (a source of high organic matter and nutrients) into the pond after Eid.
1.  The huge amount of organic waste led to a massive population boom of decomposer bacteria.
2.  These bacteria consume a large amount of dissolved oxygen from the water as they break down the waste.
3.  This rapid consumption of oxygen depleted the available supply faster than it could be replenished, leaving the fish unable to breathe.

---

**(c) Why was Rahim Mia repeatedly hitting the water surface to save the fish? (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
Rahim Mia was repeatedly hitting the water surface in an attempt to **increase the amount of dissolved oxygen** in the water. The primary way oxygen enters a pond is through diffusion from the atmosphere at the water's surface. By hitting the water with a bamboo stick, he was:
1.  **Increasing Surface Area:** Creating splashes and ripples, which increases the surface area of the water that is in contact with the air.
2.  **Agitating the Water:** This agitation promotes mixing between the oxygen-rich surface layer and the oxygen-depleted deeper water.
Both of these actions help to speed up the rate at which oxygen from the atmosphere dissolves into the water, providing the gasping fish with the oxygen they desperately needed to survive. It is a rudimentary form of mechanical aeration.

---

**(d) Discuss the harmful aspects of discharging household waste into a water body without any treatment. (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
Discharging untreated household waste into a water body has several harmful aspects:
1.  **Eutrophication and Oxygen Depletion:** Organic waste (like food scraps and sewage) is rich in nutrients. This leads to algal blooms and a population explosion of decomposer bacteria, which consume all the dissolved oxygen, killing fish and other aquatic life.
2.  **Spread of Waterborne Diseases:** Untreated sewage contains harmful pathogens like bacteria and viruses that cause diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery, making the water unsafe for human use.
3.  **Chemical Pollution:** Household waste often contains detergents with phosphates and other chemicals that are toxic to aquatic organisms and disrupt the ecosystem.
4.  **Aesthetic Degradation:** It makes the water body foul-smelling, visually unappealing, and unsuitable for recreational activities.

---

**(b) Explain the effect of free radicals on the human body. (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Free radicals are highly destructive to the human body. They cause **oxidative stress** by "stealing" electrons from stable molecules in cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids in cell membranes. This damage is cumulative and contributes to:
*   **Aging:** It is a major factor in the physical aging process.
*   **Chronic Diseases:** It is linked to the development of numerous diseases, including cancer, heart disease, arthritis, and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's.
*   **Inflammation:** It promotes chronic inflammation throughout the body.

---

**(c) What is the role of vitamins and anti-oxidants in maintaining health? (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Vitamins and anti-oxidants play a crucial defensive role in maintaining health. Many vitamins, particularly **Vitamin C and Vitamin E**, are powerful anti-oxidants. Their primary role is to **neutralize harmful free radicals** by donating an electron without becoming unstable themselves. This action protects cells from oxidative damage, reduces inflammation, strengthens the immune system, and helps prevent the onset of many chronic diseases, thereby promoting overall health and longevity.

---

**(d) Give a scientific analysis of how Karim Shaheb's lifestyle, as described in the scenario, helped him to achieve longevity. (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
Karim Shaheb's lifestyle incorporated several key factors that are scientifically proven to contribute to longevity:
1.  **Healthy Diet:** His diet of fresh fruits, salads, and vegetables provided him with a rich supply of **vitamins and anti-oxidants**. By avoiding oily and fatty foods, he reduced his intake of unhealthy fats, lowering his risk of heart disease and obesity. Eating little (caloric restriction) is also linked to a longer lifespan.
2.  **Regular Physical Activity:** His habit of playing sports and exercising regularly in his youth and continuing with morning walks helped maintain cardiovascular health, strong bones and muscles, and a healthy weight.
3.  **Low Stress and Positive Outlook:** Being an honest, pious person who thought about the welfare of others suggests a life with lower levels of chronic stress and a strong sense of purpose. Low stress levels are associated with reduced inflammation and a lower risk of many chronic diseases, contributing significantly to a long and healthy life.

    1.  **Mutation:** A change or error in the DNA sequence of a single gene.
    2.  **Chromosomal Abnormality:** An error in the number or structure of chromosomes, such as having an extra chromosome (like in Down syndrome) or a missing part of a chromosome.

---

**(c) How can the paternity of a disputed couple be confirmed through a DNA test? (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
The paternity of a disputed couple can be confirmed with near-certainty through a DNA test by following these steps:
1.  **Sample Collection:** DNA samples are collected from the child, the mother, and the alleged father (usually through a simple cheek swab).
2.  **DNA Profiling:** In the lab, specific, highly variable regions of the DNA from each person are analyzed to create a unique "DNA profile" for each individual.
3.  **Comparison:** The child's DNA profile is then compared to the profiles of the mother and the alleged father. A child inherits half of their DNA from each biological parent.
4.  **Confirmation:** If the man is the biological father, then for every genetic marker, one of the child's two versions must match the mother's, and the other must match the alleged father's. If this matching pattern is consistent across multiple markers, paternity is confirmed with an accuracy of over 99.9%.

---

### **Question 7**

**(a) How many colors are found when white light is analyzed? What are the colors? (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
When white light is analyzed (e.g., by passing it through a prism), **seven** colors are found. The colors are **Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red** (often remembered by the acronym VIBGYOR).

---

**(b) Why is red light always used for danger signals on roads? (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
Red light is used for danger signals because it has the **longest wavelength** of all the colors in the visible spectrum. According to Rayleigh's Law of Scattering, light with longer wavelengths is scattered the least by particles in the atmosphere (like fog, rain, or dust). Because it scatters less, red light can travel the farthest through the air and remain clearly visible from a long distance, even in poor weather conditions, making it the most effective color for conveying a critical signal like "stop" or "danger".

---

**(c) Why is the color of the sky red on the horizon at sunrise and sunset? (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
At sunrise and sunset, the sunlight has to travel through a much thicker layer of the Earth's atmosphere to reach our eyes compared to midday.
1.  As the light travels this long path, most of the shorter-wavelength light (blue and violet) is scattered away from our direct line of sight by the air molecules.
2.  This leaves the longer-wavelength light (red and orange) to pass through directly to our eyes.
As a result, the sun itself and the sky around it appear reddish or orange.

---

**(d) Give a description of the properties of light. (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
The key properties of light are:
1.  **Rectilinear Propagation:** Light travels in straight lines in a uniform medium.
2.  **Reflection:** Light bounces off a surface.
3.  **Refraction:** Light bends when it passes from one medium to another.
4.  **Dispersion:** White light splits into its constituent colors when passed through a prism.
5.  **Wave-Particle Duality:** Light exhibits properties of both waves (like diffraction and interference) and particles (photons).
6.  **Speed:** It travels at a constant, maximum speed in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s).

---

### **Question 8**

2.  **Acetic Acid:** Source - Vinegar
3.  **Lactic Acid:** Source - Yogurt, sour milk
4.  **Tartaric Acid:** Source - Grapes, tamarind
5.  **Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C):** Source - Amla, citrus fruits

---

**(d) Why is vinegar used to process pickles? (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
Vinegar is used to process pickles because it is an effective **preservative**. Its active component, acetic acid, creates a highly **acidic environment** (low pH). This acidic environment inhibits the growth of most spoilage-causing bacteria, mold, and other microorganisms that would otherwise cause the vegetables to rot. It preserves the pickles, extending their shelf life and adding a characteristic tangy flavor.

---

### **Question 9**

**Answer:**
*   **Name of Chlorine Compound:** **Bleaching Powder** (Calcium hypochlorite, Ca(OCl)₂).
*   **How it Disinfects:** When bleaching powder is added to water, it releases **hypochlorous acid (HOCl)**. Hypochlorous acid is a powerful oxidizing agent that effectively kills harmful microorganisms like bacteria and viruses by destroying their cell walls and essential enzymes, thus disinfecting the water.

---

**(c) What is Pasteurization? What is the reason for milk getting spoiled even after pasteurization if kept at room temperature? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Pasteurization:** Pasteurization is a process of heating a liquid (like milk) to a specific temperature for a set period to kill most of the harmful pathogenic bacteria. It is not sterilization; it does not kill all microorganisms.
*   **Reason for Spoilage:** Pasteurized milk spoils at room temperature because the process does not kill all microorganisms. It leaves some harmless, spoilage-causing (thermoduric) bacteria. At warm room temperatures, these surviving bacteria multiply rapidly, fermenting the milk's lactose into lactic acid, which causes the milk to sour and spoil. Refrigeration slows down this bacterial growth.

### **Question 11**

**Explain with a recent example the powerful role of web-based social media in creating mass awareness in the context of Bangladesh. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Web-based social media, particularly platforms like Facebook, plays a powerful role in creating rapid mass awareness in Bangladesh. A recent and prominent example is the response to various social justice issues or public crises.
*   **Example:** During the **2018 Road Safety Movement**, students used social media extensively to organize protests and spread their message. Photos, videos, and live streams of protests and traffic mismanagement went viral on Facebook within hours. This created immense public pressure and drew national and international attention to the issue of road safety far more quickly and effectively than traditional media could have. Social media acted as a primary tool for mobilization, communication, and holding authorities accountable, demonstrating its powerful role in creating mass awareness and driving social change.
