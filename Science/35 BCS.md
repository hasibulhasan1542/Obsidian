**1. Fermentation and Biotechnology**


_(a) Write the names of three dairy products produced through biotechnology. (1.5 Marks)_

- Yogurt
- Cheese
- Butter

_(b) What is the starter culture mentioned in the stimulus? What does it contain? (2 Marks)_

- **Starter Culture:** The starter culture mentioned is the small amount of old yogurt added to the milk. It serves as an inoculum to initiate the fermentation process.
- **Contents:** It contains live lactic acid bacteria (LAB), primarily species like _Lactobacillus bulgaricus_ and _Streptococcus thermophilus_. These bacteria are responsible for fermenting milk sugar (lactose) into lactic acid.

_(c) What is the reason for Minhaz's failure in making yogurt? (1 Mark)_

- Minhaz added the starter culture to the milk while it was still boiling or very hot. The high temperature likely killed the live bacteria in the starter culture, preventing fermentation and coagulation of the milk.

_(d) Explain the process of milk turning into yogurt. (3 Marks)_

- The process of converting milk to yogurt is fermentation driven by Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB).
    1. **Inoculation:** A starter culture containing live LAB (like _Lactobacillus bulgaricus_ and _Streptococcus thermophilus_) is added to pasteurized and cooled milk (ideally around 40-45°C, not boiling hot as Minhaz did).
    2. **Fermentation:** The bacteria ferment the lactose (milk sugar) present in the milk into lactic acid.
    3. **Coagulation:** As lactic acid concentration increases, the pH of the milk decreases (becomes acidic). This acidity causes the milk protein (casein) to denature and coagulate, thickening the milk into the semi-solid gel characteristic of yogurt.
    4. **Flavor Development:** The fermentation process also produces various compounds that contribute to the characteristic flavor and aroma of yogurt.
    5. **Incubation:** Maintaining the optimal temperature (around 37-45°C) is crucial for bacterial growth and activity during the incubation period.

**2. Agriculture, Environment, and Food Chains**

_(Scenario: With the expansion of modern agricultural practices, the presence of frogs and birds in Bangladesh's agricultural land is no longer observed as before. Destruction of habitat and unfavorable breeding environments are the reasons.)_

_(a) Why is the presence of frogs and birds not observed in crop fields as before? Mention specific reasons for each case. (2 Marks)_

- **Frogs:**
    - **Pesticide Use:** Widespread use of pesticides in modern agriculture kills frogs directly or eliminates their insect food sources. Frogs are also very sensitive to chemical pollutants absorbed through their skin.
    - **Habitat Loss:** Drainage of wetlands, ponds, and ditches near farmlands destroys frog habitats and breeding sites.
- **Birds:**
    - **Pesticide Use:** Insecticides kill the insects that birds feed on, reducing their food supply. Birds can also be directly poisoned by consuming contaminated seeds or insects.
    - **Habitat Loss:** Removal of trees, hedges, and diverse vegetation around fields reduces nesting sites and shelter for birds.
    - **Monoculture:** Large fields planted with a single crop offer less diverse food sources and habitats compared to traditional mixed farming.

_(b) Explain how frogs and birds help in environment-friendly agricultural management. (1.5 Marks)_

- Frogs and birds are natural pest controllers.
    - **Frogs:** Feed on large quantities of insects, slugs, and other invertebrates that damage crops.
    - **Birds:** Many bird species consume insects, rodents, and weed seeds, helping to keep pest populations in check naturally.
- Their presence reduces the need for chemical pesticides, contributing to a healthier ecosystem, protecting beneficial insects (like pollinators), and preventing soil and water contamination, thus promoting environment-friendly agriculture.

_(c) "Harmful chemical substances like DDT are now part of the food chain" - Analyze this statement with specific information. (3 Marks)_

- This statement is accurate due to the processes of **bioaccumulation** and **biomagnification**.
    - **Persistence:** DDT is a persistent organic pollutant (POP), meaning it breaks down very slowly in the environment.
    - **Bioaccumulation:** When DDT enters an ecosystem (e.g., through agricultural runoff), it is absorbed by organisms (like plankton or insects). Since it's not easily excreted, it accumulates in their fatty tissues over time.
    - **Biomagnification:** Organisms higher up the food chain consume contaminated prey. At each trophic level, the concentration of DDT becomes magnified. For example, insects absorb DDT from plants/soil -> frogs/small fish eat many insects -> larger fish/birds eat many small fish/frogs.
    - **Impact:** As a result, top predators (like birds of prey, larger fish, and even humans consuming contaminated fish or produce) accumulate dangerously high levels of DDT, even if the initial environmental concentration was low. This can cause reproductive failure (e.g., thinning eggshells in birds), developmental issues, and other health problems, demonstrating how persistent chemicals become integral parts of the food chain with amplified effects at higher levels.

**4. Health, Diet, and Longevity**

_(Scenario: Centenarian Karim Saheb has no friends left for his regular morning walk. He eats sparingly, avoiding oily/fatty foods his whole life. Fresh fruits, salads, and vegetables were part of his daily diet. He played sports and exercised regularly in his youth. He was an honest government official, always thought of people's welfare, and was pious.)_

_(a) What are Vitamins, Anti-oxidants, and Free radicals? (1.5 Marks)_

- **Vitamins:** Organic compounds essential in small quantities for normal metabolism, growth, and bodily function. They must generally be obtained from the diet as the body cannot synthesize them sufficiently.
- **Anti-oxidants:** Molecules that inhibit oxidation. They protect cells from damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals by neutralizing them. Examples include Vitamin C, Vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium.
- **Free Radicals:** Highly reactive and unstable molecules with unpaired electrons. They are produced during normal metabolic processes or by exposure to environmental factors (pollution, radiation). They can damage cells, proteins, and DNA by "stealing" electrons from other molecules.

_(b) Explain the effects of free radicals on the human body. (1.5 Marks)_

- Free radicals can cause **oxidative stress** when their production overwhelms the body's antioxidant defenses. This oxidative stress is implicated in:
    - Cellular damage (damaging cell membranes, proteins, DNA).
    - Aging process.
    - Development or exacerbation of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders (like Alzheimer's), and inflammatory conditions.

_(c) What is the role of vitamins and anti-oxidants in maintaining health? (1.5 Marks)_

- **Vitamins:** Perform numerous vital roles, acting as coenzymes in metabolic reactions, supporting immune function, aiding vision, promoting bone health, enabling blood clotting, and acting as antioxidants. Each vitamin has specific functions essential for overall health.
- **Anti-oxidants:** Protect the body by neutralizing harmful free radicals. This protection helps prevent or reduce cellular damage linked to aging and various chronic diseases, supporting overall health and potentially contributing to longevity. Karim Saheb's diet rich in fruits and vegetables likely provided ample antioxidants.

_(d) Scientifically analyze how Karim Saheb's lifestyle, as described in the stimulus, helped him achieve longevity. (3 Marks)_

- Karim Saheb's longevity can be scientifically attributed to several lifestyle factors described:
    1. **Healthy Diet:** His diet emphasized fresh fruits, salads, and vegetables, while avoiding oily/fatty foods. This provided essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, while limiting unhealthy fats associated with cardiovascular disease. Antioxidants helped combat cellular damage from free radicals. Low-fat intake reduced risks of heart disease and obesity.
    2. **Regular Exercise:** Lifelong physical activity (morning walks, earlier sports/exercise) improves cardiovascular health, maintains muscle mass and bone density, helps control weight, reduces stress, and lowers the risk of many chronic diseases.
    3. **Stress Management/Mental Well-being:** His described nature as honest, pious, and concerned with others' welfare suggests lower levels of chronic stress and potentially better social connections, both linked to better health outcomes and longevity. Chronic stress negatively impacts cardiovascular and immune health.
    4. **Moderation (Implied):** Being a "স্বল্পাহারী" (one who eats sparingly) suggests caloric moderation, which is linked in some studies to increased lifespan.

**5. Genetics and Biotechnology**

_(a) How many chromosomes are there in human body cells? How many of them are sex chromosomes? (1 Mark)_

- Human body cells (somatic cells) typically contain 46 chromosomes.
- Out of these, 2 are sex chromosomes (XX in females, XY in males).

_(b) What is meant by a gene? Write two causes of genetic disorders. (1.5 Marks)_

- **Gene:** A gene is a basic physical and functional unit of heredity. It is a specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA (or sometimes RNA) located usually on a chromosome, that codes for a functional product, either RNA or protein.
- **Causes of Genetic Disorders:**
    1. **Mutations:** Changes in the DNA sequence of a single gene.
    2. **Chromosomal Abnormalities:** Changes in the number or structure of entire chromosomes (e.g., Down syndrome - extra chromosome 21).

_(c) How can the paternity of a disputed couple be confirmed through DNA testing? (2 Marks)_

- DNA testing confirms paternity by comparing the DNA profiles of the child, the mother, and the potential father.
    1. **Sample Collection:** DNA samples (usually from cheek swabs or blood) are collected from the child, mother, and alleged father.
    2. **Analysis:** Specific, highly variable regions of DNA (like STRs - Short Tandem Repeats) are analyzed for each individual to create a DNA profile.
    3. **Comparison:** A child inherits half of their DNA from their biological mother and half from their biological father. The child's DNA profile will show markers inherited from the mother and markers inherited from the father. By comparing the child's profile with the mother's and the alleged father's, it's possible to determine if the markers the child didn't inherit from the mother match those of the alleged father. A high degree of matching confirms paternity.

_(d) Analyze the role of GMOs in agricultural science. (3 Marks)_

- Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) play significant roles in agricultural science:
    1. **Increased Crop Yields:** Genetic modification can enhance yields by improving resistance to pests, diseases, or harsh environmental conditions (drought, salinity).
    2. **Pest Resistance:** Crops like Bt corn or Bt cotton are engineered to produce their own insecticide (derived from _Bacillus thuringiensis_), reducing the need for chemical pesticide application.
    3. **Herbicide Tolerance:** Crops like Roundup Ready soybeans are modified to tolerate specific herbicides, allowing farmers to control weeds more effectively.
    4. **Enhanced Nutritional Value:** GMOs like Golden Rice are engineered to produce higher levels of certain nutrients (like Vitamin A precursors) to combat deficiencies in staple crops.
    5. **Improved Crop Quality:** Modifications can improve shelf life, processing characteristics, or appearance of agricultural products.
    6. **Disease Resistance:** Engineering resistance to viral or fungal diseases can protect crops from significant losses.

**6. Health and Disease**

_(a) Write the difference between Antibiotic and Antiseptic. (1.5 Marks)_

- **Antibiotic:** A substance, typically produced by microorganisms or synthesized, that inhibits the growth of or destroys bacteria. Antibiotics are used _internally_ (taken orally or injected) to treat bacterial infections within the body.
- **Antiseptic:** A chemical agent applied to _living tissue_ (like skin) to inhibit or kill microorganisms and prevent infection. Antiseptics are used _externally_ to cleanse wounds or prepare skin for surgery. They are generally too toxic for internal use.

_(b) Write the name of the virus transmissible through date palm sap. (1 Mark)_

- Nipah virus (NiV).

_(c) Write the names of three viral diseases that have recently or in the near past spread in different countries of the world. (2 Marks)_

- COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2)
- Ebola Virus Disease
- Zika Virus Disease

_(d) What is food poisoning? Give examples of different types of food poisoning, citing specific causes. (3 Marks)_

- **Food Poisoning:** An illness caused by consuming food contaminated with harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins produced by these microorganisms[cite:1 22]. Symptoms often include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever.
- **Examples and Causes:**
    1. **Bacterial Food Poisoning:**
        - _Salmonella:_ Found in contaminated eggs, poultry, meat, unpasteurized milk. Causes salmonellosis.
        - _Escherichia coli_ (E. coli - pathogenic strains like O157:H7): Found in undercooked ground beef, contaminated produce, unpasteurized milk. Can cause severe diarrhea and kidney damage.
        - _Staphylococcus aureus:_ Produces toxins in improperly stored foods (cooked meats, dairy products, salads). Causes rapid onset of vomiting and cramps.
    2. **Viral Food Poisoning:**
        - _Norovirus:_ Highly contagious, often spread by infected food handlers or contaminated water/shellfish. Causes vomiting and diarrhea.
    3. **Toxin-Mediated Food Poisoning:**
        - _Bacillus cereus:_ Produces toxins in improperly cooked or stored rice and starchy foods. Can cause vomiting or diarrhea.
        - _Clostridium botulinum:_ Produces a potent neurotoxin in improperly canned or preserved foods. Causes botulism, a serious paralytic illness.

**7. Light**

_(a) How many colors are obtained when white light is dispersed? What are the colors? (1.5 Marks)_

- Seven colors are obtained when white light is dispersed.
- The colors are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red (often remembered by the acronym VIBGYOR).

_(b) Why is red light always used for danger signals on roads? (2 Marks)_

- Red light is used for danger signals because it has the longest wavelength among the visible colors. Light with longer wavelengths scatters the least when passing through atmospheric particles like dust, fog, or rain. Therefore, red light travels the farthest through the atmosphere without significant scattering, making it visible from a greater distance even in poor visibility conditions, which is crucial for safety signals.

_(c) Why does the sky appear red on the horizon during sunrise and sunset? (2 Marks)_

- During sunrise and sunset, sunlight has to travel through a much thicker layer of the Earth's atmosphere to reach our eyes compared to midday. As sunlight passes through this long path, shorter wavelength colors (like blue and violet) are scattered away more effectively by atmospheric particles (Rayleigh scattering). The longer wavelength colors (red and orange) are scattered less and continue through the atmosphere to reach our eyes, making the sun and the sky near the horizon appear reddish or orange.

_(d) Describe the properties of light. (2 Marks)_

- Key properties of light include:
    1. **Rectilinear Propagation:** Light travels in straight lines in a uniform medium.
    2. **Reflection:** Light bounces off surfaces. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
    3. **Refraction:** Light bends when it passes from one medium to another (e.g., from air to water) due to a change in speed.
    4. **Dispersion:** White light splits into its constituent colors (spectrum) when passing through a prism, due to different colors refracting at slightly different angles.
    5. **Wave Nature:** Light exhibits wave properties like diffraction (bending around obstacles) and interference (superposition of waves).
    6. **Particle Nature (Quantum):** Light also behaves as particles called photons, explaining phenomena like the photoelectric effect. It has wave-particle duality.
    7. **Speed:** Light travels at a constant, finite speed in a vacuum, approximately 3×108 meters per second. Its speed decreases in other media.

**8. Acids and Bases**

_(a) Write the definitions of Acid and Base. (1.5 Marks)_

- **Acid:** (Arrhenius definition) A substance that produces hydrogen ions (H+) or hydronium ions (H3​O+) when dissolved in water. (Brønsted-Lowry definition) A proton (H+) donor. (Lewis definition) An electron pair acceptor.
- **Base:** (Arrhenius definition) A substance that produces hydroxide ions (OH−) when dissolved in water. (Brønsted-Lowry definition) A proton (H+) acceptor. (Lewis definition) An electron pair donor.

_(b) Write the names of three weak and three strong acids. (2 Marks)_

- **Strong Acids:**
    1. Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
    2. Sulfuric acid (H2​SO4​)
    3. Nitric acid (HNO3​)
- **Weak Acids:**
    1. Acetic acid (CH3​COOH) (in vinegar)
    2. Carbonic acid (H2​CO3​) (in carbonated drinks)
    3. Citric acid (C6​H8​O7​) (in citrus fruits)

_(c) Write the names of five acids that we consume with food, mentioning their sources. (2 Marks)_

- 1. **Acetic Acid:** Source - Vinegar.
- 2. **Citric Acid:** Source - Citrus fruits (lemons, oranges).
- 3. **Lactic Acid:** Source - Yogurt, sour milk.
- 4. **Malic Acid:** Source - Apples, grapes.
- 5. **Tartaric Acid:** Source - Grapes, tamarinds.

_(d) Why is vinegar used to process pickles? (2 Marks)_

- Vinegar (which contains acetic acid) is used in pickling primarily as a **preservative**. The acidity created by the vinegar lowers the pH of the food (like cucumbers or mangoes) to a level where most spoilage-causing bacteria, yeasts, and molds cannot grow or survive. This extends the shelf life of the food significantly. Vinegar also contributes to the characteristic tangy flavor of pickles.
