**(c) Describe two methods of producing electrical energy from sunlight. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Two primary methods for producing electricity from sunlight are:
1.  **Photovoltaic (PV) Method:** This method uses **solar panels** made of photovoltaic cells (usually from silicon). When sunlight (photons) strikes these cells, it excites electrons, creating a direct electric current (DC). This DC electricity can then be used directly, stored in batteries, or converted to alternating current (AC) by an inverter for use in homes and businesses.
2.  **Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) Method:** This method uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight from a large area onto a small receiver. The concentrated light heats a fluid (like water or molten salt) to a very high temperature, producing steam. This steam then drives a conventional turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity, similar to a traditional power plant.

**(l) Name and briefly describe the two main protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The two main protocols are:
1.  **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** TCP is a **connection-oriented** protocol. It ensures that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order. It establishes a connection before sending data, breaks large data into smaller packets, and checks for errors, re-transmitting any lost packets. It is used for applications where reliability is crucial, like web browsing and email.
2.  **IP (Internet Protocol):** IP is a **connectionless** protocol responsible for addressing and routing packets. Its job is to take packets from TCP and deliver them to the correct destination address across networks. It does not guarantee delivery or order; that is TCP's responsibility.

**(a) Explain Kirchhoff's Current and Voltage Law. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
1.  **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):** It states that the algebraic sum of all currents entering a junction (or node) in a circuit is equal to the sum of all currents leaving that junction. This is based on the conservation of charge.
2.  **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):** It states that the algebraic sum of all the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero. This is based on the conservation of energy.

**(b) What is electromagnetic induction? Describe it briefly. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Electromagnetic Induction:** The production of an electromotive force (or voltage) across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field.
*   **Brief Description:** Discovered by Michael Faraday, this principle states that if a conductor is placed in a changing magnetic field (or if a conductor moves through a magnetic field), a current will be induced in the conductor. This is the fundamental principle behind electric generators, transformers, and inductors.

**(c) Briefly describe the working principle of an electric motor. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The working principle of an electric motor is based on the fact that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.
1.  An electric motor consists of a coil of wire (the armature) placed between the poles of a magnet.
2.  When an electric current is passed through the coil, the magnetic field exerts a force on the two sides of the coil in opposite directions.
3.  These opposing forces create a turning effect, or torque, which causes the coil to rotate.
4.  A device called a commutator reverses the direction of the current in the coil every half rotation, ensuring that the coil continues to spin in the same direction. This continuous rotation converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.

**(d) Write the full form of RADAR. Explain its working principle. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Full Form:** **RA**dio **D**etection **A**nd **R**anging.
*   **Working Principle:** A radar system transmits a pulse of radio waves. These waves travel through the air and reflect off an object. The radar's antenna detects the returning echo. By measuring the time it takes for the echo to return, the system can calculate the distance to the object. It can also determine the object's speed using the Doppler effect.

**(e) What is a Transformer? Describe its working principle briefly. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Transformer:** A transformer is a static electrical device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction, usually with a change in voltage and current.
*   **Working Principle:** It works on the principle of **mutual induction**. An alternating current (AC) in the primary coil creates a changing magnetic field in the iron core. This changing field induces an AC voltage in the secondary coil. Transformers only work with AC.

**(f) What is a Solar Cell? Describe a Photovoltaic System. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Solar Cell (or Photovoltaic Cell):** A solar cell is an electronic device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity through the photovoltaic effect.
*   **Photovoltaic (PV) System:** A PV system is a complete system designed to supply usable solar power. It consists of:
    *   **Solar Panels:** To capture sunlight and convert it into DC electricity.
    *   **Inverter:** To convert the DC electricity into AC electricity for use in homes and businesses.
    *   **Mounting and Racking:** To hold the panels in place.
    *   **Batteries (optional):** To store excess energy for use at night or on cloudy days.

**(g) What is Modulation? What are its types? Explain its necessity. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Modulation:** The process of varying one or more properties of a periodic high-frequency carrier wave (like its amplitude, frequency, or phase) in accordance with a lower-frequency message signal that contains information.
*   **Types:** The main types are Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Phase Modulation (PM).
*   **Necessity:** It is necessary because low-frequency message signals cannot be transmitted efficiently over long distances. Modulation impresses the low-frequency information onto a high-frequency carrier wave, which can travel long distances with less power and allows for the use of smaller, more practical antennas.

**(h) Discuss the role of a Zener Diode in a Voltage Stabilizer. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
A Zener diode plays a crucial role as a **voltage reference** in a voltage stabilizer circuit. It is a special type of diode designed to operate in the reverse breakdown region.
*   **Role:** When a Zener diode is reverse-biased, it maintains a constant, stable voltage across itself (the "Zener voltage") even if the current flowing through it changes.
*   **In a Stabilizer:** In a simple stabilizer circuit, the Zener diode is used to provide a very stable reference voltage. The circuit compares the output voltage to this stable Zener voltage. If the output voltage deviates, the circuit adjusts it to bring it back in line with the reference, thus stabilizing the output.
