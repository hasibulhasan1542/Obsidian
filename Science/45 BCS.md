**1. Light and Electromagnetic Waves**

_(a) How many types of reflection of light are there and what are they? Explain. (1.5 Marks)_

There are two main types of reflection of light:

1. **Regular Reflection (or Specular Reflection):** This occurs when a parallel beam of light strikes a smooth, polished surface (like a mirror). The reflected rays are also parallel to each other. It follows the laws of reflection precisely (angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane). This type of reflection forms clear images.
2. **Irregular Reflection (or Diffuse Reflection):** This occurs when a parallel beam of light strikes a rough or uneven surface (like paper, wood, or walls). The light rays are reflected in many different directions because the surface normals at different points are oriented randomly. Although each individual ray still obeys the laws of reflection at its point of incidence, the overall reflected rays are scattered. This type of reflection allows us to see non-luminous objects from different angles but does not form a clear image.

    - **If strong acid (H+) is added:** The added H+ ions react with the conjugate base (CH3​COO−) present in large concentration: CH3​COO−(aq)+H+(aq)⇌CH3​COOH(aq). This converts the strong acid (H+) into the weak acid (CH3​COOH), minimizing the change in pH.
    - **If strong base (OH−) is added:** The added OH− ions react with the weak acid (CH3​COOH) present in large concentration: CH3​COOH(aq)+OH−(aq)⇌CH3​COO−(aq)+H2​O(l). This neutralizes the strong base, again minimizing the change in pH. The presence of significant amounts of both the weak acid and its conjugate base allows the buffer to neutralize both added acid and added base.

_(d) What is the function of ascorbic acid? (1 Mark)_

Ascorbic acid is Vitamin C. Its functions include:

- Acting as a powerful antioxidant, protecting cells from free radical damage.
- Being essential for the synthesis of collagen, a protein vital for skin, blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, and bone.
- Aiding in the absorption of iron from plant-based foods.

**4. Biochemistry and Nutrition**

_(a) What are monosaccharides and polysaccharides? What is the difference between the basic structures of starch and cellulose? (2.5 Marks)_

- **Monosaccharides:** These are the simplest form of carbohydrates, often called simple sugars. They consist of a single polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone unit (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose) and serve as the basic building blocks for more complex carbohydrates. They cannot be hydrolyzed into smaller sugar units.
- **Polysaccharides:** These are complex carbohydrates composed of long chains of monosaccharide units linked together by glycosidic bonds. They can be linear or branched (e.g., starch, cellulose, glycogen).
- **Difference between Starch and Cellulose Structures:** Both starch and cellulose are polymers of glucose, but they differ in the type of glycosidic bond linking the glucose units:
    - **Starch:** Glucose units are linked primarily by α-1,4 glycosidic bonds, with branches formed by α-1,6 glycosidic bonds (in amylopectin). This structure results in a helical shape. Starch is digestible by humans.
    - **Cellulose:** Glucose units are linked by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds. This linkage results in long, straight, unbranched chains that pack closely together via hydrogen bonds, forming strong fibers. Cellulose is indigestible by humans due to the lack of enzymes to break β-1,4 bonds.

_(b) Give the basic concepts of food and nutrition. (2 Marks)_

- **Food:** Any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food usually consists of plant or animal origin and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.
- **Nutrition:**6 The science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health, and disease of an organism[cite:7 1]. It involves the processes by which an organism ingests, digests, absorbs, transports, utilizes, and excretes food substances. Proper nutrition means obtaining the right amount and types of nutrients from healthy food choices to support overall health and well-being.

_(c) What are vitamins, anti-oxidants, and free radicals? Explain their role in maintaining health. (3 Marks)_

- **Vitamins:** Organic compounds essential in small quantities for various metabolic processes and overall health. They often act as coenzymes or regulators.
- **Anti-oxidants:** Molecules that inhibit the oxidation of other molecules, thereby preventing damage caused by free radicals. They donate electrons to stabilize free radicals.
- **Free Radicals:** Highly reactive atoms or molecules with unpaired electrons, produced during metabolism or by environmental factors. They can damage cells, DNA, and proteins.
- **Role in Health:**
    - **Vitamins:** Crucial for growth, development, energy production, immune function, vision, bone health, etc. Deficiencies lead to specific diseases (e.g., scurvy from lack of Vitamin C, rickets from lack of Vitamin D).
    - **Anti-oxidants:** Protect the body from oxidative stress caused by free radicals. This protection is linked to reducing the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders, and slowing the aging process. Vitamins like C and E, and compounds in fruits and vegetables act as antioxidants.
    - **Free Radicals:** While some are necessary for processes like immune response, excess free radicals cause oxidative stress, damaging cells and contributing to aging and various diseases. A balance between free radicals and antioxidants is essential for health.

    - **Ecosystem Disruption:** Shifts in habitats, loss of biodiversity, impacts on agriculture and water resources.

_(b) What is the importance of the ozone layer? How can we protect it? (3 Marks)_

- **Importance of the Ozone Layer:** The ozone layer, located in the stratosphere, is crucial because it absorbs most of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV-B and UV-C) radiation. This absorption protects life on Earth from damaging effects like:
    - Increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts in humans.
    - Damage to immune systems.
    - Harm to marine life (plankton) and terrestrial plants, affecting ecosystems and agriculture.
- **Protection Measures:** The primary way to protect the ozone layer is by phasing out the production and use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), primarily chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform. This has been achieved through international agreements like the **Montreal Protocol**. Actions include:
    - Developing and using alternatives to ODS in refrigeration, air conditioning, aerosols, and foam blowing.
    - Proper disposal and recycling of old appliances containing ODS.
    - Continued monitoring of the ozone layer and atmospheric ODS concentrations.
    - Adherence to and strengthening of international treaties like the Montreal Protocol.

**6. Genetics and Technology**

_(a) What is a chromosome? How can chromosomes be classified based on the position of the centromere? (2.5 Marks)_

- **Chromosome:** A chromosome is a thread-like structure located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells (or in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes). It is formed of protein (primarily histones) and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA contains the specific instructions (genes) that make each type of living creature unique. Chromosomes become condensed and visible during cell division.
- **Classification based on Centromere Position:** Chromosomes are classified into four types based on the location of the centromere (the constricted region that joins sister chromatids):
    1. **Metacentric:** Centromere is located exactly in the middle, resulting in two arms of equal length (looks V-shaped during anaphase).
    2. **Submetacentric:** Centromere is located slightly off-center, resulting in one arm being somewhat shorter than the other (looks L-shaped during anaphase).
    3. **Acrocentric:** Centromere is located very close to one end, resulting in one very short arm (p arm) and one very long arm (q arm) (looks J-shaped during anaphase). Often have satellites on the short arm.
    4. **Telocentric:** Centromere is located at the very end of the chromosome, resulting in only one visible arm (looks I-shaped during anaphase). (Not typically found in humans).

_(b) What is gene therapy? Discuss the genetic diseases Huntington's and Down syndrome. (2.5 Marks)_

- **Gene Therapy:** An experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. It aims to correct genetic disorders by replacing a faulty gene, adding a new gene, or inactivating a malfunctioning gene.

_(a) What is polymerization? Write how polymers are made from monomers. (2.5 Marks)_

- **Polymerization:** A chemical process in which relatively small molecules, called monomers, combine chemically to produce a very large chainlike or network molecule, called a polymer[cite:8 1].
- **Process:** Polymers are formed from monomers through polymerization reactions. There are two main types:
    1. **Addition Polymerization:** Monomers (usually containing a double or triple bond) add to each other sequentially without the loss of any atoms. The process involves initiation (creating an active site), propagation (chain growth by adding monomers), and termination (stopping the chain growth). Example: Formation of polyethylene from ethylene monomers.
    2. **Condensation Polymerization:** Monomers (containing functional groups like -OH, -COOH, -NH2) react to form larger structural units while releasing smaller molecules such as water (H2​O), ammonia (NH3​), or methanol (CH3​OH) as byproducts. Example: Formation of nylon or polyester.

_(b) Mention the differences between cellulosic and non-cellulosic fibers. (2.5 Marks)_

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Cellulosic Fibers**|**Non-Cellulosic Fibers**|
|**Source/Origin**|Derived from plants where cellulose is the main component.|Synthesized chemically (synthetic) or derived from non-plant natural sources (protein, mineral).|

_(c) What is polyethylene? Discuss how polyethylene and plastic pollute agricultural land. (2.5 Marks)_

- **Polyethylene:** A thermoplastic polymer consisting of long chains of the monomer ethylene (C2​H4​). It is one of the most widely produced plastics, used in packaging (plastic bags, films, bottles), containers, toys, etc.
- **Pollution of Agricultural Land:**
    - **Persistence:** Polyethylene and other plastics are non-biodegradable, persisting in the soil for hundreds of years.
    - **Soil Structure Damage:** Accumulation of plastic sheets (e.g., mulching films) or fragments disrupts soil structure, aeration, and water infiltration, hindering root growth.
    - **Waterlogging:** Plastic debris can clog soil pores and drainage channels, leading to waterlogging.
    - **Microplastic Formation:** Larger plastic items break down into microplastics, which contaminate the soil and can be ingested by soil organisms (earthworms), potentially entering the food chain.
    - **Toxic Chemicals:** Some plastics contain additives (plasticizers, stabilizers) that can leach into the soil, potentially harming soil organisms and contaminating crops.
    - **Reduced Fertility:** Physical presence of plastic reduces the volume of fertile soil available for plant growth.

**8. Water Quality and Treatment**

_(a) Write three criteria for water purity. (1.5 Marks)_

Three criteria for water purity are:

1. **Microbiological Safety:** Absence of harmful microorganisms like pathogenic bacteria (e.g., E. coli, Salmonella, Cholera vibrio), viruses, and parasites that cause waterborne diseases.
2. **Chemical Safety:** Low levels of toxic chemicals (heavy metals like lead, arsenic, mercury; pesticides; industrial pollutants) and acceptable levels of dissolved minerals (TDS - Total Dissolved Solids, hardness). Concentrations should be below established safe limits for drinking water.
3. **Physical Properties:** Water should be clear (low turbidity), colorless, and odorless, indicating the absence of excessive suspended particles or undesirable dissolved substances.

_(b) Write the importance of dissolved oxygen in water. (1.5 Marks)_

Dissolved oxygen (DO) refers to the amount of gaseous oxygen (O2​) dissolved in water. Its importance lies in:

- **Aquatic Life Respiration:** DO is essential for the survival of aerobic aquatic organisms, including fish, invertebrates (like crabs and oysters), and aerobic bacteria. They use DO for respiration, just as terrestrial animals use oxygen from the air.
- **Water Quality Indicator:** The level of DO is a critical indicator of water quality. Low DO levels (hypoxia or anoxia) indicate pollution (often from excess organic waste or nutrient runoff causing algal blooms followed by decomposition) and can lead to fish kills and harm aquatic ecosystems.
- **Decomposition:** Aerobic bacteria use DO to decompose organic matter. Low DO slows down this natural purification process.

_(c) Discuss the different methods of water purification. (2.5 Marks)_

Common methods of water purification include:

1. **Screening:** Removing large debris (leaves, sticks) using screens at the intake.
2. **Coagulation and Flocculation:** Adding chemicals (coagulants like alum) to cause small suspended particles to clump together into larger flocs.
3. **Sedimentation:** Allowing the heavier flocs to settle down in tanks due to gravity.
4. **Filtration:** Passing water through filters (sand, gravel, charcoal, or membranes) to remove remaining suspended particles, turbidity, and some microorganisms. Activated carbon filters also remove taste and odor compounds.
5. **Disinfection:** Killing remaining harmful microorganisms (bacteria, viruses) using chlorine, chloramine, ozone, or ultraviolet (UV) light.
6. **Boiling:** Heating water to a rolling boil kills most pathogens (suitable for household use).
7. **Reverse Osmosis (RO):** Using pressure to force water through a semipermeable membrane, removing dissolved salts, chemicals, and microorganisms.
8. **Distillation:** Boiling water and condensing the steam to produce highly purified water, free from dissolved solids.

_(d) What should you do as a citizen to prevent water pollution? (2 Marks)_

As a citizen, one can take several actions to prevent water pollution:

- **Proper Waste Disposal:** Avoid throwing trash, chemicals, oils, paints, or medicines into drains, toilets, rivers, or lakes. Dispose of hazardous waste appropriately.
- **Reduce Chemical Use:** Minimize the use of pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers in gardens and lawns; opt for organic alternatives. Use biodegradable cleaning products.
- **Conserve Water:** Using less water reduces the amount of wastewater that needs treatment.
- **Prevent Runoff:** Avoid washing cars where soap runs into storm drains. Properly maintain septic systems. Use porous surfaces for driveways/patios to allow rainwater infiltration.
