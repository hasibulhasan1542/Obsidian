**1. (c) What is Pasteurization? Why does milk get spoiled at room temperature even after Pasteurization? (3.5)**

- **Pasteurization:** Pasteurization is a process of heating liquids like milk to a specific temperature for a certain period to kill most bacteria and other microorganisms.
- **Spoilage after Pasteurization:** Even after pasteurization, some heat-resistant bacteria or spores may survive. At room temperature, these microorganisms can multiply over time and eventually cause the milk to spoil.

**2. (a) Write the chemical composition of the chromosome. (2)**

- Chromosomes are composed of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and proteins. The DNA carries the genetic information, and the proteins, mainly histones, help in packaging and organizing the DNA.

**2. (b) How does fast food harm the human body? (2)**

- Fast foods are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, sodium, and sugar, but low in essential nutrients like vitamins and fiber. Regular consumption can lead to obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, and other health problems.

**2. (c) Discuss the importance of gene technology in agricultural development. (3.5)**

- Gene technology can improve crop yields, increase resistance to pests and diseases, enhance nutritional value, and develop tolerance to environmental stresses like drought and salinity.

**3. (a) What kind of test is required to confirm paternity? (2)**

- DNA testing is the primary method used to confirm paternity. It compares the DNA of the child with that of the alleged father.

**3. (b) To which group does the SARS-CoV-2 virus belong? Which organ of the body does this virus first and most severely damage and why? What kind of steps are necessary to prevent the infection of this virus? (5.5)**

- SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the coronavirus family.
- This virus primarily affects the respiratory system, particularly the lungs. It damages the lungs because it enters the cells lining the respiratory tract, causing inflammation and impairing lung function.
- Prevention steps include:
    - Vaccination
    - Wearing masks
    - Social distancing
    - Hand hygiene
    - Respiratory etiquette

**4. (a) Write the definition of acid and base. (2)**

- **Acid:** A substance that donates protons (H+) or accepts electrons.
- **Base:** A substance that accepts protons (H+) or donates electrons.

**4. (b) Write three names each of weak and strong acids. (3)**

- **Weak acids:** Acetic acid, citric acid, carbonic acid
- **Strong acids:** Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid

**4. (c) What is vinegar? Write its chemical formula. Why is vinegar used to process pickles? (2.5)**

- Vinegar is an aqueous solution of acetic acid.
- The chemical formula of vinegar is CH3COOH.
- Vinegar is used to process pickles because its acidity inhibits the growth of spoilage-causing bacteria, thus preserving the food.

**5. (a) Define scalar and vector quantities. (2)**

- **Scalar quantity:** A scalar quantity has only magnitude (size). Examples: temperature, mass, time.
- **Vector quantity:** A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction. Examples: velocity, force, displacement.

**5. (b) What is sound pollution? What are its harmful effects? (3.5)**

- **Sound pollution:** Excessive or disturbing noise that disrupts human or animal life.
- **Harmful effects:** Hearing loss, stress, sleep disturbance, high blood pressure.

**5. (c) Write the application of tuning fork. (2)**

- Tuning forks are used to produce a standard frequency for tuning musical instruments, in medical examinations to assess hearing, and in physics demonstrations to illustrate resonance.

**6. (a) What is BOD and TDS of water? (2)**

- **BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand):** The amount of oxygen required by microorganisms to decompose the organic matter in water.
- **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids):** The total amount of inorganic and organic substances dissolved in water.

**6. (b) What are LDL and HDL? Describe their functions in the human body. (3)**

- **LDL (Low-density lipoprotein):** Often called "bad" cholesterol, it transports cholesterol to the body's cells. High levels can lead to plaque buildup in arteries.
- **HDL (High-density lipoprotein):** Often called "good" cholesterol, it helps remove cholesterol from the arteries and carries it back to the liver.

**6. (c) What is the Rh factor of blood? Why is it important? (2.5)**

- The Rh factor is an antigen on the surface of red blood cells. People are either Rh-positive or Rh-negative.
- It is important in blood transfusions and pregnancy because Rh incompatibility between mother and fetus can cause complications.

**7. (a) What is refraction of light? Write the laws of refraction of light. (3.5)**

- **Refraction of light:** The bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different optical density.
- **Laws of refraction:**
    - The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
    - The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media (Snell's Law).

**7. (b) Describe the human hearing process. (8)**

- Sound waves enter the ear canal and cause the eardrum to vibrate. These vibrations are transmitted through the ossicles (tiny bones) in the middle ear to the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea converts these vibrations into electrical signals, which are sent to the brain via the auditory nerve, where they are interpreted as sound.

**8. (a) Discuss the causes of soil acidity. (8)**

- Causes of soil acidity include:
    - Leaching of base cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium) by rainfall.
    - Decomposition of organic matter.
    - Use of acid-forming fertilizers.
    - Acid rain.
    - Weathering of parent materials.

**8. (b) Discuss the importance of renewable energy. (2)**

- Renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) are important because they are sustainable, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and produce less pollution.

**8. (c) Discuss the importance of biodiversity conservation. (1.5)**

- Biodiversity conservation is important for maintaining ecosystem health, providing essential resources, and ensuring long-term ecological balance.

**9. (a) Discuss the role of zinc-rich food in the human body. (2)**

- Zinc is essential for immune function, wound healing, protein synthesis, and cell growth.

**9. (b) How many and what are the fat-soluble vitamins? Discuss the importance of these vitamins in the human body. (8)**

- The fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K.
- **Vitamin A:** Important for vision, immune function, and cell growth.
- **Vitamin D:** Essential for calcium absorption and bone health.
- **Vitamin E:** Acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage.
- **Vitamin K:** Necessary for blood clotting.

**9. (c) Why are all enzymes in modern biology not called proteins? Give reasons with examples. (1.5)**

- While most enzymes are proteins, some RNA molecules can also act as enzymes (ribozymes). Therefore, it's more accurate to say that most, but not all, enzymes are proteins.
