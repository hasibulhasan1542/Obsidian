**(c) What is Pasteurization? Why does pasteurized milk spoil when kept at room temperature? (1.5 + 2 = 3.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Pasteurization:** Pasteurization is a process of heating a liquid (like milk) to a specific temperature for a set period to kill or inactivate most of the harmful pathogenic bacteria. It is not sterilization; it does not kill all microorganisms. A common method is heating milk to 72°C for 15 seconds.
*   **Reason for Spoilage:** Pasteurized milk spoils at room temperature because the process does not kill all microorganisms. It eliminates the harmful pathogens that cause disease but leaves some harmless, spoilage-causing (thermoduric) bacteria. At warm room temperatures, these surviving bacteria multiply rapidly, consuming the lactose in the milk and producing lactic acid, which causes the milk to sour and spoil. Refrigeration slows down this bacterial growth, extending the milk's shelf life.

    2.  **Second Law (Snell's Law):** For a given pair of media, the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence (i) to the sine of the angle of refraction (r) is a constant. This constant is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.
        **Formula:** $$\frac{sin(i)}{sin(r)} = constant (\mu)$$

---

### **Question 8**

**(a) Discuss the causes of soil acidity. (4 marks)**

**Answer:**
Soil acidity (low pH) is caused by several natural and man-made factors:
1.  **High Rainfall (Leaching):** In regions with heavy rainfall, water percolates through the soil and leaches away basic cations like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. These are replaced by acidic cations like hydrogen and aluminum, making the soil acidic.
2.  **Parent Material:** Soils that develop from acidic parent rocks, such as granite and sandstone, are naturally more acidic.
3.  **Decomposition of Organic Matter:** The decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms releases carbon dioxide, which forms weak carbonic acid in the soil water.
4.  **Use of Nitrogen Fertilizers:** The application of ammonium-based nitrogen fertilizers can lead to soil acidification through a process called nitrification.
5.  **Acid Rain:** Atmospheric pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from industrial emissions can dissolve in rainwater to form acid rain, which lowers the pH of the soil.

    4.  **Vitamin K:** Plays a vital role in blood clotting, which is essential to prevent excessive bleeding. It is also important for bone health.

---

**(c) In modern biology, why are not all enzymes called proteins? Justify with an example. (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
In modern biology, not all enzymes are called proteins because it has been discovered that some **RNA molecules**, called **ribozymes**, can also act as biological catalysts.
*   **Justification with Example:** For a long time, it was believed that only proteins had the complex three-dimensional structures needed for catalytic activity. However, the discovery of ribozymes proved this wrong. A key example is the **ribosome**, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. The part of the ribosome that catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids is actually an RNA component, not a protein. This demonstrates that catalysis is not an exclusive property of proteins.

    *   **Digital Signal:** A discrete wave that represents information in a binary format (0s and 1s). It is more immune to noise.
*   **Relationship between Wavelength and Frequency:** Wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) are **inversely proportional**. This means that as the frequency of a wave increases, its wavelength decreases, and vice versa. Their relationship is defined by the formula: `c = fλ`, where 'c' is the constant speed of the wave (the speed of light for electromagnetic waves).

**(b) Describe Kirchhoff's Voltage Law with a diagram. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):** It states that the algebraic sum of all the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero. This law is based on the conservation of energy.

**Diagram and Explanation:**
In the series circuit below, a voltage source (V) provides a voltage rise. The current (I) flows through resistors R₁ and R₂, creating voltage drops (V₁ and V₂) across them.
```
      +-------[ R₁ ]-------+
      |                    |
      V (+)                |
      | (-)                |
      +-------[ R₂ ]-------+
```
According to KVL, the sum of the voltage rises must equal the sum of the voltage drops.
`V - V₁ - V₂ = 0` or `V = V₁ + V₂`

**(e) Briefly describe how Radar works. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**RADAR** (Radio Detection and Ranging) works on the principle of transmitting radio waves and analyzing the echoes that return.
1.  **Transmission:** A radar system transmits a pulse of high-frequency radio waves from an antenna.
2.  **Reflection:** These waves travel through the air and reflect off an object (e.g., an airplane, a ship).
3.  **Reception:** A small part of the reflected wave (the echo) travels back and is detected by the radar's receiver.
4.  **Analysis:** The system calculates the **distance** to the object based on the time it took for the echo to return. It can also determine the object's **speed** by measuring the frequency shift in the echo (Doppler effect) and its **location** from the direction the antenna was pointing.

**(f) Briefly describe the working principle of an electrical transformer. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The working principle of an electrical transformer is **mutual induction**. It consists of two coils, a primary and a secondary coil, wound on a common iron core. When an **alternating current (AC)** flows through the primary coil, it creates a continuously changing magnetic field in the core. According to Faraday's Law of Induction, this changing magnetic field induces an AC voltage in the secondary coil. The voltage is "stepped up" or "stepped down" depending on the ratio of the number of turns in the two coils. Transformers only work with AC, not DC.

**(h) Briefly explain how a circuit breaker works with a diagram. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
A circuit breaker is an automatic switch that protects a circuit from overcurrent. A common type (MCB) uses two mechanisms:
1.  **Thermal Trip (for Overloads):** A bimetallic strip heats up and bends when a sustained overcurrent flows. This bending trips a switch, opening the circuit.
2.  **Magnetic Trip (for Short Circuits):** A very high, sudden current creates a strong magnetic field in a coil, which instantly pulls a plunger to trip the switch.

**Diagram:**
A simplified diagram would show the bimetallic strip and the electromagnet connected to a switch/latch mechanism inside the circuit breaker's housing.
```
   [ Input ]----(Bimetallic Strip)----(Switch Latch)----[ Output ]
                     |
                  (Electromagnet)

### **Question 11**

**(a) Write the main difference between Analog and Digital signals. Explain the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a wave. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Difference between Analog and Digital Signals:**
    *   **Analog Signal:** A continuous wave that represents information in a continuous range of values. It is more susceptible to noise and degradation.
    *   **Digital Signal:** A discrete wave that represents information in a binary format (a series of 0s and 1s) at distinct intervals. It is more immune to noise.

*   **Relationship between Wavelength and Frequency:**
    Wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) of a wave are **inversely proportional**. This means that as the frequency of a wave increases, its wavelength decreases, and vice versa. The relationship is defined by the formula:
    `c = fλ`
    where:
    *   `c` is the constant speed of the wave (e.g., the speed of light for electromagnetic waves).
    *   `f` is the frequency.
    *   `λ` is the wavelength.

**(b) Describe Kirchhoff's Voltage Law with a diagram. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):** This law states that the algebraic sum of all the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop or mesh in a circuit is equal to zero. This law is based on the principle of conservation of energy.

**Diagram and Explanation:**
Consider a simple series circuit with a voltage source (V) and two resistors (R₁ and R₂).

```
      +-------[ R₁ ]-------+
      |                    |
      V (+)                |   (Current I flows in this direction)
      | (-)                |
      +-------[ R₂ ]-------+
```

1.  The battery provides a voltage rise (V).
2.  As current (I) flows through the resistors, it creates a voltage drop across each one (V₁ across R₁ and V₂ across R₂).
3.  According to KVL, for the closed loop, the sum of voltage rises must equal the sum of voltage drops.
    Therefore: `V = V₁ + V₂`
    Or, expressed as an algebraic sum around the loop: `V - V₁ - V₂ = 0`

**(e) Briefly describe how Radar works. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**RADAR** (which stands for **RA**dio **D**etection **A**nd **R**anging) works on the principle of transmitting radio waves and analyzing the echoes that return after hitting an object. The process is as follows:
1.  **Transmission:** The radar system's antenna transmits a short pulse of high-frequency radio waves in a specific direction.
2.  **Reflection (Echo):** These waves travel through the air until they strike an object (like an airplane or a ship), at which point they are reflected in various directions.
3.  **Reception:** A small portion of the reflected waves (the echo) travels back to the radar's antenna, which now acts as a receiver.
4.  **Analysis:** The system's computer analyzes the echo to determine:
    *   **Distance:** Calculated from the time it took for the echo to return.
    *   **Direction:** Determined by the direction the antenna was pointing when the echo was received.
    *   **Speed:** Calculated by measuring the change in the echo's frequency (the Doppler effect).

**(f) Briefly describe the working principle of an electrical transformer. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The working principle of an electrical transformer is **mutual electromagnetic induction**. A transformer consists of two separate coils of wire, a **primary coil** and a **secondary coil**, that are wound on a common laminated iron core.
1.  When an **alternating current (AC)** is passed through the primary coil, it creates a continuously changing magnetic field (or magnetic flux) in the iron core.
2.  This changing magnetic flux links with the secondary coil.
3.  According to Faraday's Law of Induction, this changing flux induces an alternating voltage in the secondary coil.
The voltage is "stepped up" if the secondary coil has more turns than the primary, and "stepped down" if it has fewer turns. Transformers only work with AC, as DC produces a constant magnetic field which cannot induce a voltage.

**(h) Briefly explain how a circuit breaker works with a diagram. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
A circuit breaker is an automatic electrical switch designed to protect a circuit from damage caused by an overcurrent. It works using two mechanisms:

1.  **Thermal Trip (for Overloads):** A **bimetallic strip** inside the breaker heats up and bends when a sustained, moderate overcurrent flows through it. This bending trips a mechanical latch, opening the circuit. This protects against overloaded circuits.
2.  **Magnetic Trip (for Short Circuits):** A very high and sudden surge of current (a short circuit) creates a strong magnetic field in an **electromagnet** (solenoid). This magnetic force instantly pulls a plunger that trips the latch, opening the circuit much faster than the thermal mechanism.

**Simplified Diagram Description:**
A diagram would show the input and output terminals connected through a pair of contacts. One contact is movable and held in place by a spring-loaded latch. Both the bimetallic strip and the electromagnet are positioned to release this latch when activated, causing the contacts to spring apart and break the circuit.
```
