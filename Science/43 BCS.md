**(b) What is a decibel? What is its acceptable level for school students? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Decibel (dB):** A decibel is a logarithmic unit used to measure the intensity or loudness of a sound. The decibel scale is logarithmic, meaning that a small increase in decibels represents a large increase in sound intensity. For example, a 10 dB increase corresponds to a 10-fold increase in sound intensity.
*   **Acceptable Level:** The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that noise levels inside classrooms should not exceed **35 dB** to ensure a good learning environment. In Bangladesh, schools are designated as "silent zones," where the acceptable noise limit is generally **50 dB** during the day.

**(b) What is ozone gas? What harm does this gas do to the human body? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Ozone Gas (O₃):** Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms. Its role depends on its location in the atmosphere. In the stratosphere, it forms the protective "ozone layer" that absorbs harmful UV radiation.
*   **Harm to the Human Body:** When ozone is present in the troposphere (ground-level ozone), it is a harmful air pollutant and a primary component of smog. Inhaling ground-level ozone can:
    *   Irritate the respiratory system, causing coughing and throat soreness.
    *   Reduce lung function and make it more difficult to breathe deeply.
    *   Aggravate asthma and other chronic lung diseases like bronchitis and emphysema.
    *   Increase susceptibility to respiratory infections.

---

**(c) What is carbon emission? What are its harmful effects on the atmosphere and ways to control it? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Carbon Emission:** The release of carbon, primarily in the form of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄), into the atmosphere. The main source is the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation.
*   **Harmful Effects:** Carbon emissions are the primary driver of the **enhanced greenhouse effect**. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to **global warming** and **climate change**. The consequences include rising sea levels, more frequent and intense extreme weather events (heatwaves, floods, droughts), and disruption of ecosystems.
*   **Ways to Control It:**
    1.  **Transition to Renewable Energy:** Shifting from fossil fuels to solar, wind, and hydropower.
    2.  **Improve Energy Efficiency:** Using less energy in homes, industries, and transportation.
    3.  **Afforestation and Reforestation:** Planting trees, which absorb CO₂.
    4.  **Carbon Capture Technologies:** Developing technologies to capture CO₂ emissions from sources like power plants.

### **Question 3**

**(a) What is a triglyceride? What is its role in the human body? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Triglyceride:** A triglyceride is a type of fat (lipid) found in the blood. It is the main constituent of body fat in humans and is also found in vegetable and animal fats. Chemically, it is an ester formed from a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid molecules.
*   **Role in the Human Body:**
    1.  **Energy Storage:** The primary role of triglycerides is to store unused calories. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides, which are stored in fat cells.
    2.  **Energy Source:** Between meals, hormones release these stored triglycerides for energy.
    3.  **Insulation and Protection:** Body fat provides insulation against cold and cushions vital organs.
    While essential, very high levels of triglycerides in the blood are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.

---

**(b) How can blood sugar and high blood pressure be controlled without medicine? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Blood sugar and high blood pressure can often be managed or controlled through significant lifestyle modifications:
1.  **Dietary Changes:**
    *   **For Blood Sugar:** Reduce intake of refined carbohydrates and sugary foods. Focus on high-fiber foods, whole grains, and lean proteins.
    *   **For Blood Pressure:** Limit sodium (salt) intake. Follow a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy (like the DASH diet).
2.  **Regular Physical Activity:** Engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like brisk walking, cycling) per week.
3.  **Weight Management:** Losing even a small amount of excess weight can significantly improve both blood sugar and blood pressure levels.
4.  **Stress Reduction:** Practicing stress-management techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing.
5.  **Limit Alcohol and Quit Smoking:** Both alcohol and smoking can raise blood pressure and affect blood sugar control.

---

**(c) Is controlling cholesterol in food the only way to reduce blood cholesterol? Explain. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
No, controlling the amount of cholesterol in food is **not** the only, or even the most effective, way to reduce blood cholesterol.
**Explanation:**
The majority of cholesterol in our blood is actually produced by our own liver. The amount of cholesterol the liver produces is more strongly influenced by the types of fat we eat than by the amount of cholesterol we eat.
*   **Saturated and Trans Fats:** Diets high in saturated fats (found in red meat, butter) and trans fats (found in fried and processed foods) are the main dietary culprits. These fats signal the liver to produce more harmful LDL cholesterol.
*   **Other Factors:** Beyond diet, other factors like genetics, physical inactivity, and being overweight also play a major role in determining blood cholesterol levels.
Therefore, a more effective strategy is to reduce intake of saturated and trans fats, increase physical activity, and maintain a healthy weight, rather than solely focusing on the cholesterol content of food.

**(c) What do you mean by DNA and RNA? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):** DNA is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. It is often referred to as the "blueprint of life." Structurally, it is a double helix, composed of two long chains of nucleotides.

**RNA (Ribonucleic Acid):** RNA is a molecule that plays several vital roles in the coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. Unlike the double-stranded DNA, RNA is typically single-stranded. Its primary function is to act as a messenger (mRNA), carrying instructions from the DNA in the cell's nucleus to the ribosomes, where proteins are synthesized.

### **Question 5**

**(a) What is fiber-rich food? Write its importance for human health. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Fiber-rich Food:** Dietary fiber is a type of carbohydrate found in plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes. Unlike other carbohydrates, it cannot be digested or absorbed by the human body.
*   **Importance for Human Health:**
    1.  **Promotes Digestive Health:** It adds bulk to stool, which helps prevent constipation and maintain regular bowel movements.
    2.  **Helps Control Blood Sugar:** Soluble fiber can slow the absorption of sugar, helping to improve blood sugar levels.
    3.  **Lowers Cholesterol:** It can help lower levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart disease.
    4.  **Aids in Weight Management:** High-fiber foods are more filling, which can help you eat less and stay satisfied longer.

---

**(b) Provide a daily balanced diet chart for a pregnant mother. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
A balanced diet for a pregnant mother should be rich in folic acid, iron, calcium, and protein. Here is a sample daily chart:
*   **Breakfast:** One bowl of oatmeal or fortified cereal with milk, one boiled egg, and a banana.
*   **Mid-morning Snack:** A handful of almonds and an apple.
*   **Lunch:** A portion of brown rice, a bowl of lentil soup (dal), a serving of lean chicken or fish curry, and a large portion of mixed vegetable salad.
*   **Afternoon Snack:** A cup of yogurt and a piece of fruit.
*   **Dinner:** Two whole-wheat rotis, a serving of leafy green vegetables (like spinach), and a bowl of beans or paneer curry.
    *It is also crucial to drink plenty of water throughout the day.*

**(c) How do rubber and plastic disrupt the balance of our environment? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Rubber and plastic disrupt the environmental balance in several significant ways:
1.  **Non-Biodegradability:** Most plastics and synthetic rubbers do not biodegrade. They persist in the environment for hundreds or thousands of years, accumulating in landfills, soil, and oceans.
2.  **Pollution:** They break down into smaller particles called **microplastics**, which contaminate soil and water. These particles can absorb toxins and are ingested by wildlife, entering the food chain and potentially harming human health.
3.  **Harm to Wildlife:** Animals can mistake plastic debris for food or become entangled in it, leading to injury, suffocation, and death.
4.  **Resource Depletion:** The majority of plastics are produced from fossil fuels, which are finite, non-renewable resources.
5.  **Air Pollution:** The manufacturing process and the burning of plastic waste release greenhouse gases and toxic fumes into the atmosphere.

### **Question 6**

**(a) What is light? Discuss the electromagnetic theory of light. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Light:** Light is a form of energy and a type of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye. It behaves as both a wave and a particle (a concept known as wave-particle duality).
*   **Electromagnetic Theory of Light:** Proposed by James Clerk <font color="#ffff00">Maxwell</font> in the 19th century, this theory states that light consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Key points of the theory are:
    *   The electric and magnetic fields vibrate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of the wave's propagation, making light a **transverse wave**.
    *   Light does not require a medium to travel and can propagate through a vacuum.
    *   The speed of light in a vacuum (c) is a universal constant, approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s.
    This theory successfully unified electricity, magnetism, and optics.

**Particle Theory of Light**
The particle theory of light, also known as the quantum theory of light, posits that light is composed of a stream of discrete, massless particles or energy packets called **photons**.

Key aspects of this theory are:

1. **Quantized Energy:** Each photon carries a specific, discrete amount of energy (a quantum) which is directly proportional to the frequency of the light. This is described by the equation **E = hf**, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency.
    
2. **Photoelectric Effect:** This theory successfully explains the **photoelectric effect**, where light hitting a metal surface can eject electrons. This phenomenon could not be explained by the classical wave theory of light and provided strong evidence for the particle nature of light.

**(b) Write the names of different electromagnetic waves in order of energy and wavelength. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The electromagnetic spectrum is arranged in order of wavelength and energy. Energy and frequency are directly proportional, while both are inversely proportional to wavelength.

**In order of increasing energy/frequency (and decreasing wavelength):**
1.  **Radio waves** (Lowest energy, longest wavelength)
2.  **Microwaves**
3.  **Infrared**
4.  **Visible Light**
5.  **Ultraviolet**
6.  **X-rays**
7.  **Gamma rays** (Highest energy, shortest wavelength)

---

**(c) What is color blindness? Explain. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Color Blindness:** Color blindness, or more accurately, color vision deficiency, is a condition where a person has a reduced ability to distinguish between certain colors. It is not usually a total inability to see color, but rather a difficulty with specific color pairs.
*   **Explanation:** This condition occurs due to a problem with the color-sensing pigments in the **cone cells** of the retina. The retina has three types of cone cells, each sensitive to red, green, or blue light. If one or more of these types of cones are faulty or absent, the person will have a color deficiency. The most common form is **red-green color blindness**, which is a genetic condition passed down on the X chromosome, making it far more common in males than in females.

### **Question 7**

**(a) Define acid and base. Mention two modern theories about them. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Acid:** Traditionally, an acid is a substance that tastes sour, reacts with metals, and turns blue litmus paper red.
*   **Base:** Traditionally, a base is a substance that tastes bitter, feels slippery, and turns red litmus paper blue.
*   **Two Modern Theories:**
    1.  **Brønsted-Lowry Theory:** This theory defines an acid as a **proton (H⁺ ion) donor** and a base as a **proton (H⁺ ion) acceptor**. This theory is broader as it is not limited to aqueous solutions.
    2.  **Lewis Theory:** This is the most general theory. It defines an acid as an **electron-pair acceptor** and a base as an **electron-pair donor**.

---

**(b) What is pH? Write the names of two organic and two inorganic acids and comment on their pH. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **pH:** pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration (`pH = -log[H⁺]`). A pH of 7 is neutral, a pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic.
*   **Acids and their pH:**
    1.  **Organic Acids:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), Citric acid.
    2.  **Inorganic (Mineral) Acids:** Hydrochloric acid (HCl), Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).
*   **Comment on pH:** Organic acids are generally **weak acids**, meaning they do not fully dissociate in water. Their pH would be in the mildly acidic range (e.g., pH 2.5 to 6). Most common inorganic acids are **strong acids**, meaning they dissociate completely. Their pH would be in the highly acidic range (e.g., pH 0 to 2).

---

**(c) How many types of salts are there? Write the name and example of each type. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Based on their formation from acids and bases, salts can be classified into three main types:
1.  **Normal (or Neutral) Salt:** Formed by the complete neutralization of a strong acid and a strong base. Their aqueous solution has a pH of approximately 7.
    *   **Example:** Sodium Chloride (NaCl)
2.  **Acidic Salt:** Formed from the reaction of a strong acid and a weak base. Their aqueous solution is acidic (pH < 7) due to the hydrolysis of the cation.
    *   **Example:** Ammonium Chloride (NH₄Cl)
3.  **Basic Salt:** Formed from the reaction of a weak acid and a strong base. Their aqueous solution is basic (pH > 7) due to the hydrolysis of the anion.
    *   **Example:** Sodium Acetate (CH₃COONa)

---

### **Question 8**

**(a) What is the difference between water and heavy water? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The primary difference between normal water (H₂O) and heavy water (D₂O) lies in the isotope of hydrogen they contain.
*   **Composition:**
    *   **Water (H₂O):** Contains the most common hydrogen isotope, **protium (¹H)**, which has a nucleus with only one proton.
    *   **Heavy Water (D₂O):** Contains a heavier hydrogen isotope, **deuterium (²H or D)**, which has a nucleus with one proton and one neutron.
*   **Properties:** Due to the heavier deuterium atom, heavy water is about 10% denser than normal water and has slightly higher boiling and freezing points. Its main use is as a neutron moderator in certain types of nuclear reactors.

---

**(b) What is a hydrogen bond? Write the effect of hydrogen bonds on water and ice. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Hydrogen Bond:** A hydrogen bond is a special type of <font color="#ffff00">electrostatic attraction</font> between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine) and another nearby electronegative atom. It is stronger than a typical van der Waals interaction but weaker than a covalent bond.
*   **Effect on Water and Ice:**
    *   **In Liquid Water:** Hydrogen bonds are constantly forming and breaking, pulling the water molecules close together. This is responsible for many of water's unique properties, such as its high boiling point and high surface tension.
    *   **In Ice:** As water freezes, the hydrogen bonds lock the water molecules into a fixed, open hexagonal crystal lattice. This orderly arrangement forces the molecules farther apart than they are in the liquid state, making ice **less dense than liquid water**. This is why ice floats.

---

**(c) Give your opinion on dealing with the future crisis of pure water. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Dealing with the future crisis of pure water requires a multi-faceted and integrated approach involving technology, policy, and individual action. My opinion is that the focus must be on sustainability and efficiency. Key strategies should include:
1.  **Aggressive Water Conservation:** This is the most cost-effective solution. We must drastically reduce water waste in agriculture (through drip irrigation), industries, and our homes.
2.  **Wastewater Treatment and Reuse:** Investing in advanced technologies to treat wastewater to a high standard, making it safe for reuse in agriculture, industry, or even for replenishing groundwater.
3.  **Sustainable Desalination:** Making desalination of seawater more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly by powering it with renewable energy.
4.  **Protecting Natural Sources:** Implementing and enforcing strict policies to prevent the pollution of rivers, lakes, and groundwater from industrial and agricultural runoff.
5.  **Public Awareness:** Educating the public about the value of water to foster a culture of conservation.

**(b) Describe Open Circuit and Short Circuit with suitable diagrams. Write the main problem of these circuits. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Open Circuit:** An open circuit is an electrical circuit that has a break in its path, preventing the flow of current.
    *   **Diagram:** A simple circuit with a battery, a lamp, and a switch shown in the open position.
    *   **Explanation:** In an open circuit, the resistance is infinitely high, and therefore, the current is zero.
    *   **Main Problem:** The circuit is incomplete, so the intended load (e.g., a lamp) will not receive power and will not function.

*   **Short Circuit:** A short circuit is an abnormal connection between two points of a circuit with very low resistance, creating a new path for the current to bypass the intended load.
    *   **Diagram:** A circuit with a battery and a lamp, where a wire is shown connecting the positive and negative terminals of the battery directly, bypassing the lamp.
    *   **Explanation:** This low-resistance path causes an extremely high current to flow from the power source.
    *   **Main Problem:** The excessive current can cause overheating, damage the power source, melt wires, and create a serious fire hazard.

**(c) Explain the difference between: (i) AC voltage & DC voltage, and (ii) IPS & UPS. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**(i) Difference between AC voltage and DC voltage:**

| Feature               | AC (Alternating Current) Voltage                                             | DC (Direct Current) Voltage                                                |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direction of Flow** | The polarity periodically reverses, causing the current to change direction. | The polarity is constant, and the current flows steadily in one direction. |
| **Waveform**          | Typically a sine wave.                                                       | A straight, constant line.                                                 |
| **Source**            | Generated by alternators (e.g., in power plants).                            | Produced by batteries, solar cells, and power adapters.                    |

**(ii) Difference between IPS and UPS:**

| Feature | IPS (Inverter Power System) | UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Switching Time** | There is a noticeable delay (a few milliseconds) when switching from mains to battery power. | An online UPS has zero switching time, providing truly uninterrupted power. |
| **Application** | Suitable for devices that can tolerate a brief power interruption, like lights and fans. | Essential for sensitive electronic devices like computers and servers, which would shut down during a power gap. |
| **Primary Power Path** | Powers the load directly from the mains. The inverter is off. | Powers the load continuously through its inverter and battery. The mains power is used to charge the battery. |

**(d) What is the main function of a Voltage Stabilizer? Explain how it works. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Main Function:** The main function of a voltage stabilizer is to automatically maintain a constant output voltage level, protecting electrical and electronic appliances from damage caused by voltage fluctuations (both over-voltage and under-voltage) in the main power supply.

*   **How it Works:**
    A voltage stabilizer works using an autotransformer with multiple output connections called "taps." A control circuit continuously monitors the incoming voltage from the mains.
    1.  If the input voltage drops too low (under-voltage), the control circuit activates a relay or electronic switch to select a tap on the transformer that **boosts** (increases) the output voltage.
    2.  If the input voltage rises too high (over-voltage), the control circuit selects a different tap that **bucks** (decreases) the output voltage.
    By automatically switching between these taps, the stabilizer ensures that the voltage supplied to the appliance remains within a safe and stable range.
