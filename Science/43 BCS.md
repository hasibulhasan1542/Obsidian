**(b) হাইড্রোজেন বন্ধন কী? পানি ও বরফের উপর হাইড্রোজেন বন্ধনের প্রভাব লিখুন। (২.৫)**


- **Definition:**
    - A hydrogen bond is a relatively weak type of intermolecular force that forms between a hydrogen atom and a highly electronegative atom such as oxygen (O) or nitrogen (N).
    - For a hydrogen bond to form, the hydrogen atom must be covalently bonded to another highly electronegative atom.
- **Effects on Water:**
    - High Boiling Point: Hydrogen bonds between water molecules require significant energy to break, leading to water's relatively high boiling point.
    - Surface Tension: Hydrogen bonds create strong cohesive forces between water molecules, resulting in high surface tension.
    - Cohesion and Adhesion: Cohesion (attraction between water molecules) and adhesion (attraction between water and other surfaces) are due to hydrogen bonding.
- **Effects on Ice:**
    - Lower Density of Ice: The hydrogen bonds in ice arrange water molecules in a crystalline structure that is more spread out than in liquid water, making ice less dense and causing it to float.
    - Structure: Hydrogen bonds dictate the hexagonal crystalline structure of ice.
