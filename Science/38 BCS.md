**Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):** It states that the algebraic sum of all the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero.
*   **Example:** In a simple series circuit with a 9V battery connected to a 2Ω resistor and a 1Ω resistor, a current of 3A will flow. The voltage drop across the 2Ω resistor is 6V (3A × 2Ω), and the drop across the 1Ω resistor is 3V (3A × 1Ω). According to KVL:
    `+9V (rise) - 6V (drop) - 3V (drop) = 0`

**(b) What is meant by electrical power? What unit is generally used to express the capacity of a power plant? (2 + 0.5 = 2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Electrical Power:** Electrical power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or used in an electrical circuit. It is a measure of how much work an electric circuit can do in a given amount of time. Its unit is the **Watt (W)**.
*   **Unit for Power Plant Capacity:** The capacity of a power plant is very large, so it is generally expressed in **Megawatts (MW)** or **Gigawatts (GW)**.

**(c) Describe the working principle of a fuse. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
A fuse is a safety device designed to protect an electrical circuit from excessive current. Its working principle is based on the **heating effect of electric current**. A fuse contains a thin strip or wire made of a metal with a low melting point. When the normal, safe current flows through the circuit, the fuse wire remains intact. However, if an overcurrent (from an overload or short circuit) flows, the fuse wire heats up rapidly, melts, and breaks the circuit. This interruption of current flow protects the more expensive components of the appliance from being damaged.

**(d) What is an electromagnet? What is magnetic induction? (1.5 + 1 = 2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Electromagnet:** An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. It typically consists of a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core. The magnetic field exists only when the current is flowing and disappears when the current is turned off.
*   **Magnetic Induction:** Magnetic induction is the process by which a material can be magnetized by placing it in an external magnetic field. It is also the process by which a changing magnetic field can create (induce) an electric current in a conductor.

**(e) Define open circuit and short circuit with diagrams. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Open Circuit:** An electrical circuit that has an intentional or unintentional break in its path, which prevents the flow of current. The resistance is infinite.
    *   **Diagram:** A simple circuit with a battery and a lamp, where the switch is shown in the open position, creating a gap.
*   **Short Circuit:** An abnormal, low-resistance connection between two points in a circuit, which allows the current to bypass the intended load.
    *   **Diagram:** A circuit with a battery and a lamp, where a wire is shown connecting the positive and negative terminals directly, bypassing the lamp.

**(f) Describe how electricity is generated by a gas turbine. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Electricity is generated by a gas turbine in a process similar to a jet engine:
1.  **Intake and Compression:** Air is drawn into the turbine and compressed by a compressor, increasing its pressure and temperature.
2.  **Combustion:** The compressed air is then directed into a combustion chamber, where it is mixed with a fuel (usually natural gas) and ignited. This combustion creates a high-temperature, high-pressure gas.
3.  **Expansion and Power Generation:** This hot, high-pressure gas expands rapidly and rushes through a series of turbine blades, causing them to spin at high speed.
4.  **Generation:** This spinning turbine is connected by a shaft to a generator. The rotation of the generator's rotor within a magnetic field produces electricity.

**(g) Write the difference between AC and DC voltage with a diagram. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Difference:**

| Feature | AC (Alternating Current) Voltage | DC (Direct Current) Voltage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction of Flow**| The polarity periodically reverses, causing the current to change direction. | The polarity is constant, and the current flows steadily in one direction. |
*   **Diagram:**
    *   The diagram for AC voltage should be a **sine wave**, oscillating above and below a zero axis.
    *   The diagram for DC voltage should be a **straight, horizontal line** above the zero axis.

**(h) What is the difference between IPS and UPS? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**

| Feature | IPS (Inverter Power System) | UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Switching Time** | There is a noticeable delay (a few milliseconds) when switching from mains to battery power. | An online UPS has **zero switching time**, providing truly uninterrupted power. |
| **Application** | Suitable for devices that can tolerate a brief power interruption, like lights and fans. | Essential for sensitive electronic devices like computers and servers, which would shut down during a power gap. |
| **Primary Power Path**| Powers the load directly from the mains. The inverter is off until the power fails. | Powers the load continuously through its inverter and battery. The mains power is used to charge the battery. |
