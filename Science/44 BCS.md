**2. (d) Give a brief description of Monkeypox. (2.5)**

Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease caused by a virus belonging to the _Poxviridae_ family. Its symptoms are similar to those of smallpox, including fever, headache, muscle aches, and skin rashes. It is transmitted through contact with infected animals or humans. Most infected individuals recover within a few weeks, but it can be severe in some cases.

**3. (a) Oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously. Explain with an example. (3.5)**

Oxidation and reduction are chemical processes involving the transfer of electrons. Oxidation is the loss of electrons by an atom, ion, or molecule, leading to an increase in its oxidation number. Reduction is the gain of electrons by an atom, ion, or molecule, resulting in a decrease in its oxidation number.

These two processes always occur simultaneously because in a chemical reaction, if a substance loses electrons (is oxidized), another substance must gain those electrons (be reduced).

Example: The reaction between zinc (Zn) and copper ions (Cu2+).

Zn(s) + Cu2+
(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)

Here, zinc (Zn) loses two electrons and is oxidized (Zn → Zn2+ + 2e-), while copper ions (Cu2+) gain two electrons and are reduced (Cu2+ + 2e- → Cu).

**3. (b) Why does the color of an indicator change? (1.5)**

An indicator is a substance that changes color depending on the pH of the solution. This is because the structure of the indicator molecule changes with pH. The indicator molecules react with acids or bases to form different structures that absorb different wavelengths of light, resulting in a color change.

**3. (c) All alkalis are bases but all bases are not alkalis. Explain. (2.5)**

A base is a chemical substance that reacts with an acid to form salt and water. An alkali is a base that is soluble in water.

Therefore, all alkalis are bases because they can neutralize acids, but not all bases are alkalis because some bases are insoluble in water. For example, copper oxide (CuO) is a base, but it is not an alkali because it does not dissolve in water.

**4. (a) Define magnetic domain. (1.5)**

A magnetic domain is a small region within a ferromagnetic material where the magnetic moments of atoms are aligned in the same direction. This alignment causes each domain to behave like a tiny magnet.

**4. (b) Explain 'Hysteresis Loop'. (3)**

A hysteresis loop is a closed curve that shows the relationship between the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material and the applied external magnetic field. When a ferromagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field, its magnetization increases. When the field is removed, the magnetization decreases, but it does not return to zero. Applying a magnetic field in the opposite direction causes the magnetization to increase in the opposite direction, forming a loop. This loop illustrates the material's magnetic properties, such as retentivity and coercivity.

**4. (c) Explain the statement "Earth is a giant magnet". (2)**

The Earth has a magnetic field, which makes it behave like a giant magnet. This magnetic field is believed to be generated by the movement of molten metal within the Earth's outer core. It causes a compass needle to point north-south and helps many animals and birds in navigation.

**4. (d) How many magnets are possible from one magnet? (1)**

Theoretically, a magnet can be divided into an infinite number of smaller magnets. However, in reality, this division is limited at the atomic level, as individual atoms possess their own magnetic moments.

**5. (a) What is green fuel? (1)**

Green fuel is a type of fuel that has a less harmful impact on the environment. It is typically derived from renewable sources and produces lower carbon emissions. Examples include solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, and biofuels.

**5. (b) Why can't a petrol fire be extinguished with water? (2.5)**

Petrol is lighter than water and floats on its surface. When water is poured onto a petrol fire, the petrol spreads, increasing the fire area. Additionally, petrol does not mix with water, so the water cannot cool the fire.

**5. (c) Describe the possible causes of the Sitakunda tragedy. (3)**

The possible causes of the Sitakunda tragedy include the mishandling and storage of chemicals in containers. It is believed that the containers held hydrogen peroxide, which exploded due to excessive heat. Other contributing factors may include the lack of adequate fire safety measures and worker negligence.

**5. (d) What is a Silk Hole? (1)**

I am sorry, but the provided document does not contain the definition of Silk Hole.

The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere and is crucial for the environment:

- **Weather phenomena:** It is where most weather events, such as clouds, rain, and storms, occur.
- **Life support:** It contains the air we breathe and supports life on Earth.
- **Temperature regulation:** It helps regulate the Earth's temperature by trapping heat.
- **Air circulation:** It facilitates the circulation of air and moisture.

**7. (d) What is a wildfire? (1)**

A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns in wildland areas, such as forests, grasslands, or shrublands.

**8. (a) If the wavelength of sound is equal to the wavelength of white light, will any problem arise? (2)**

Yes, problems would arise. Sound waves and light waves are fundamentally different. Sound waves are mechanical waves that require a medium (like air) to travel, while light waves are electromagnetic waves that can travel through a vacuum. If sound waves had the same wavelength as white light, we would experience:

- **Inability to hear:** Sound would behave like light, and we wouldn't perceive it as sound.
- **Distorted vision:** Light would be affected by mechanical vibrations in the air, distorting our vision.

**8. (b) How can a lens be identified without any instrument? (2)**

A lens can be identified without an instrument by:

- **Magnification:** Lenses magnify or demagnify objects. Convex lenses magnify, while concave lenses demagnify.
- **Image formation:** Lenses form images. Convex lenses can form both real and virtual images, while concave lenses form virtual images.
- **Touch:** Convex lenses are thicker in the center than at the edges, while concave lenses are thinner in the center than at the edges.

**8. (c) Define total internal reflection. Write a short note on mirage. (3.5)**

- **Total internal reflection:** Total internal reflection is the phenomenon where light traveling from a denser medium to a rarer medium is completely reflected back into the denser medium when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle.
- **Mirage:** A mirage is an optical illusion caused by the refraction of light in the atmosphere. It occurs when light passes through layers of air with different temperatures and densities, causing it to bend and create an image of a distant object that appears to be located elsewhere. A common example is the appearance of a water puddle on a hot road.

**9. (a) Write the differences between radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Write the side effects of the two therapies. (3.5)**

- **Radiotherapy vs. Chemotherapy:**
    - **Radiotherapy:** Uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells in a specific area.
    - **Chemotherapy:** Uses drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body.
- **Side effects:**
    - **Radiotherapy:** Skin irritation, fatigue, hair loss in the treated area.
    - **Chemotherapy:** Nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, weakened immune system.

**9. (b) Explain: All enzymes are proteins but all proteins are not enzymes. (2)**

Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are all proteins because they are made up of amino acids. However, proteins have many other functions besides catalyzing reactions. Some proteins are structural (like collagen), some are hormones (like insulin), and some are antibodies. Therefore, while all enzymes are proteins, proteins perform diverse roles, not all of which involve enzymatic activity.

**9. (c) Why is red color used in danger signals? (2)**

Red color is used in danger signals because:

- **Longest wavelength:** Red light has the longest wavelength among visible colors.
- **Least scattering:** It is scattered the least by air molecules.
- **High visibility:** It can be seen from a greater distance and is easily noticeable, even in poor visibility conditions.
