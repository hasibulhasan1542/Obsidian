### **Part A: General Science**
**Total Marks: 60**
**(Answer any eight questions)**

---

### **Question 1**

**(a) How can the pH of a solution be determined through titration?** (2.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
The pH of a solution, particularly at the equivalence point, can be determined through an acid-base titration. The process involves:
1.  **Setup:** A known volume of the solution with unknown concentration (the analyte) is placed in a flask. A solution of a known concentration (the titrant) is slowly added from a burette.
2.  **Indicator Use:** A few drops of a suitable pH indicator are added to the analyte. The indicator changes color at a specific pH range.
3.  **Equivalence Point:** As the titrant neutralizes the analyte, the pH of the solution changes. The **equivalence point** is reached when the moles of acid equal the moles of base. At this point, the indicator undergoes a sharp color change, signaling the end of the titration.
4.  **Calculation:** By knowing the volumes and the concentration of the titrant, the concentration of the analyte can be calculated using the formula `M₁V₁ = M₂V₂`. Once the concentration of the acid or base is known, its pH can be calculated (e.g., `pH = -log[H⁺]`).
For more precision, especially with weak acids/bases, a pH meter is used instead of an indicator to plot a titration curve (pH vs. volume of titrant). The equivalence point is the point of steepest slope on the curve.

**(b) Write the importance of dissolved oxygen in water.** (2.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the amount of gaseous oxygen dissolved in water. Its importance is crucial for aquatic ecosystems:
1.  **Respiration for Aquatic Life:** Fish, invertebrates, and most aerobic aquatic organisms rely on DO for respiration, just as land animals rely on oxygen from the air. Without sufficient DO, aquatic life cannot survive.
2.  **Indicator of Water Quality:** The level of DO is a key indicator of the health of a water body. High DO levels are characteristic of healthy, unpolluted water. Low DO levels (hypoxia) often indicate pollution from organic waste or fertilizer runoff, which leads to algal blooms that consume oxygen as they decompose.
3.  **Decomposition of Organic Matter:** Aerobic bacteria use DO to break down organic waste. This natural self-purification process keeps the water clean. In the absence of DO, anaerobic decomposition occurs, producing foul-smelling and toxic substances like hydrogen sulfide.

---

**(c) Mention the characteristics of organic polymers.** (2.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
Organic polymers are large molecules (macromolecules) composed of many repeating structural units known as monomers, with a backbone primarily made of carbon atoms. Their key characteristics include:
*   **Low Density and High Strength-to-Weight Ratio:** Most polymers are lightweight yet can be very strong and durable.
*   **Versatility and Formability:** They can be easily molded, extruded, or cast into a wide variety of shapes and forms, from fine fibers to solid parts.
*   **Insulating Properties:** They are generally excellent electrical and thermal insulators.
*   **Corrosion Resistance:** Unlike metals, polymers are highly resistant to chemical corrosion and rust.
*   **Variability in Properties:** Their properties (e.g., flexibility, rigidity, transparency) can be tailored by selecting different monomers and manufacturing processes.
*   **Low Biodegradability:** Many synthetic polymers, like plastics, are not biodegradable and persist in the environment for a very long time.

---

### **Question 2**

**(a) Define: LPG & CNG.** (1 Mark)

**Answer:**
*   **LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas):** A mixture of flammable hydrocarbon gases, primarily propane and butane, which is compressed and stored as a liquid for use as fuel.
*   **CNG (Compressed Natural Gas):** Natural gas (mainly methane) that is stored at high pressure (but remains in a gaseous state) to be used as a cleaner alternative fuel for vehicles.

---

**(b) What is gene cloning?** (1 Mark)

**Answer:**
Gene cloning is the process of creating multiple, identical copies of a specific gene or DNA segment. It typically involves inserting the desired gene into a small, circular piece of DNA called a plasmid (a vector), and then introducing this recombinant plasmid into a host organism, such as a bacterium. As the bacterium reproduces, it replicates the plasmid, thereby "cloning" the inserted gene.

---

**(c) Describe the importance of gene cloning methods in medicine and agriculture.** (3 Marks)

**Answer:**
Gene cloning is a foundational technology with significant importance in both medicine and agriculture.
*   **In Medicine:**
    1.  **Production of Therapeutics:** It allows for the mass production of vital proteins like insulin (for diabetes), human growth hormone, and blood-clotting factors.
    2.  **Vaccine Development:** It is used to produce subunit vaccines, which are safer as they contain only a specific protein from the pathogen (e.g., Hepatitis B vaccine).
    3.  **Gene Therapy:** It is a critical tool for research into gene therapy, which aims to correct genetic disorders by replacing faulty genes.
    4.  **Disease Diagnosis:** Cloned genes can be used as probes to detect the presence of specific DNA sequences for diagnosing genetic diseases or infections.

*   **In Agriculture:**
    1.  **Crop Improvement (GMOs):** Gene cloning is used to create Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) with desirable traits. This includes developing crops that are resistant to pests (e.g., Bt cotton), tolerant to herbicides, or resistant to drought and disease.
    2.  **Enhanced Nutrition:** It can be used to improve the nutritional value of crops, such as "Golden Rice," which is genetically engineered to produce beta-carotene, a precursor to Vitamin A.

---

**(d) Give a brief description of Monkeypox.** (2.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease (transmitted from animals to humans) caused by the monkeypox virus, which belongs to the same family as the smallpox virus.
*   **Symptoms:** The illness typically begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, and swollen lymph nodes (a key feature distinguishing it from smallpox). This is followed by the development of a rash that progresses through several stages, forming blisters and then scabs. The illness usually lasts for 2-4 weeks.
*   **Transmission:** It can be transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected animal or person, or with materials contaminated with the virus, such as bedding. Human-to-human transmission occurs through contact with respiratory secretions, skin lesions of an infected person, or contaminated objects.
*   **Severity:** While the symptoms are similar to smallpox, monkeypox is generally less severe.

### **Question 3**

**(a) Oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously. - Explain with an example.** (3.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
This statement is the fundamental principle of redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons. These two processes are coupled and cannot happen independently; if one substance loses electrons, another substance must gain them. The substance that is oxidized is called the **reducing agent**, and the substance that is reduced is called the **oxidizing agent**.

**Example: Reaction of Zinc with Copper Sulfate**
`Zn(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + Cu(s)`

In this reaction:
1.  **Oxidation:** Solid zinc (Zn) loses two electrons to become a zinc ion (Zn²⁺).
    *   Half-reaction: `Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻`
    *   Since zinc loses electrons, it is **oxidized**. It acts as the **reducing agent**.

2.  **Reduction:** The copper ion (Cu²⁺) in the copper sulfate solution gains two electrons to become solid copper (Cu).
    *   Half-reaction: `Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu`
    *   Since the copper ion gains electrons, it is **reduced**. It acts as the **oxidizing agent**.

This example clearly shows that the oxidation of zinc and the reduction of copper ions happen at the same time in a single reaction.

---

**(b) Why does the color of an indicator change?** (1.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
An indicator changes color because it is a complex organic dye that behaves as a weak acid or a weak base. In its molecular (undissociated) form and its ionic (dissociated) form, the indicator has two different colors.

Let's consider a weak acid indicator, HIn. In solution, it establishes an equilibrium:
`HIn(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + In⁻(aq)`
(Color A)         (Color B)

According to Le Châtelier's principle, the position of this equilibrium is sensitive to the concentration of H⁺ ions (i.e., the pH).
*   **In an acidic solution:** There is a high concentration of H⁺ ions. The equilibrium shifts to the left, favoring the formation of the molecular form (HIn). The solution will show Color A.
*   **In a basic solution:** The OH⁻ ions neutralize H⁺ ions, lowering their concentration. The equilibrium shifts to the right to compensate, favoring the formation of the ionic form (In⁻). The solution will show Color B.

---

**(c) All alkalis are bases but not all bases are alkalis. Explain.** (2.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
This statement highlights the distinction between the broad category of "bases" and the specific sub-category of "alkalis."
*   **Base:** A base is a substance that can accept a proton (H⁺ ion) according to the Brønsted-Lowry definition, or a substance that can donate a pair of electrons according to the Lewis definition.
*   **Alkali:** An alkali is a specific type of base that is **soluble in water** and produces hydroxide ions (OH⁻) when dissolved.

**Explanation:**
*   **"All alkalis are bases":** This is true because any substance that dissolves in water to produce OH⁻ ions (an alkali, like NaOH) can also accept a proton, thus fitting the definition of a base.
*   **"Not all bases are alkalis":** This is also true because many substances act as bases but are **insoluble in water**. For example, copper(II) oxide (CuO) is a base because it can react with and neutralize an acid (`CuO + 2HCl → CuCl₂ + H₂O`), but it is not an alkali because it does not dissolve in water. Therefore, the set of all bases includes the set of all alkalis, but it also includes many other insoluble bases.

---

### **Question 4**

**(a) Define magnetic domain.** (1.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
A magnetic domain is a microscopic region within a ferromagnetic material (like iron, nickel, or cobalt) where the magnetic moments of the atoms are aligned in the same direction, creating a strong local magnetic field. In an unmagnetized piece of material, these domains are randomly oriented, so their individual magnetic fields cancel each other out, and the material shows no overall magnetism.

---

**(b) Explain 'Hysteresis Loop'.** (3 Marks)

**Answer:**
A **hysteresis loop** is a graph that shows the relationship between the magnetic flux density (B) induced in a ferromagnetic material and the external magnetizing field (H) applied to it. The loop demonstrates that the magnetization of the material lags behind the magnetizing field.

The key features of the loop are:
1.  **Magnetization:** As H increases from zero, B increases until it reaches a saturation point.
2.  **Retentivity:** When H is reduced back to zero, B does not return to zero. The material retains some magnetism. This residual magnetism is called **retentivity**.
3.  **Coercivity:** To bring the magnetism back to zero, a reverse magnetic field (-H) must be applied. The strength of this reverse field is called **coercivity**.
4.  **Energy Loss:** The area enclosed by the hysteresis loop is proportional to the energy lost as heat within the material during each cycle of magnetization and demagnetization. Materials for permanent magnets have a wide loop (high retentivity and coercivity), while materials for transformer cores have a narrow loop (to minimize energy loss).

---

**(c) Explain the statement "The Earth is a giant magnet".** (2 Marks)

**Answer:**
The statement "The Earth is a giant magnet" means that our planet generates its own magnetic field, much like a large bar magnet. This field, known as the geomagnetic field, has two poles: a magnetic north pole and a magnetic south pole, which are located near the geographic poles.

This magnetic field is believed to be generated by the **dynamo effect**: the motion of molten iron and nickel in the Earth's liquid outer core creates electrical currents, which in turn produce the magnetic field. The field extends far out into space, forming the **magnetosphere**, which protects Earth by deflecting harmful charged particles from the sun (solar wind). The existence of this field is why a magnetic compass needle aligns itself with the north-south direction.

---

**(d) How many magnets can be obtained from one magnet?** (1 Mark)

**Answer:**
If a single bar magnet is cut into two or more pieces, each piece will instantly become a complete magnet with its own north and south pole. Theoretically, this process can be continued down to the atomic level. Therefore, from one magnet, you can obtain two smaller magnets by cutting it once, or a virtually infinite number of microscopic magnets if you continue to divide it.

### **Question 5**

**(a) What is green fuel?** (2.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
Green fuel, also known as green energy or renewable fuel, is any fuel produced from sources that are environmentally friendly and sustainable. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and release large amounts of greenhouse gases, green fuels have a much lower carbon footprint and are derived from renewable resources.

Key characteristics of green fuels are:
*   They are produced from renewable sources like sunlight, wind, water, or biomass.
*   They cause minimal environmental pollution during production and combustion.
*   They help reduce dependency on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change.

Examples include **biofuels** (like ethanol and biodiesel), **hydrogen** (when produced using renewable energy), and electricity generated from **solar**, **wind**, and **hydropower**.

---

**(b) Why can't petrol fires be extinguished with water?** (3 Marks)

**Answer:**
Petrol (gasoline) fires cannot and should not be extinguished with water for two main reasons:
1.  **Immiscibility and Density:** Petrol is an oil-based liquid and is immiscible (does not mix) with water. Furthermore, petrol is less dense than water. When water is poured onto a petrol fire, it sinks to the bottom, leaving the burning petrol to float on top. This does nothing to extinguish the flames.
2.  **Spreading the Fire:** The force of the water can splash the burning petrol, spreading it over a wider area. This makes the fire larger and more dangerous, as the fuel continues to burn on the surface of the water.

Instead, petrol fires should be smothered using a fire extinguisher that removes the oxygen supply, such as a foam, dry powder, or carbon dioxide (CO₂) extinguisher.

---

**(c) Describe the probable causes of the Sitakunda tragedy.** (1 Mark)

**Answer:**
The probable cause of the Sitakunda depot tragedy in June 2022 was a massive fire that led to the explosive decomposition of a large, improperly stored quantity of the chemical **hydrogen peroxide**. The failure to follow safety protocols for handling hazardous materials and the lack of information provided to firefighters about the presence of these chemicals were major contributing factors to the scale of the disaster.

---

**(d) What is a sinkhole?** (1 Mark)

**Answer:**
A sinkhole is a depression or hole in the ground caused by a collapse of the surface layer. They are most often formed in regions with **karst topography**, where groundwater dissolves soluble bedrock like limestone, creating underground caverns that eventually collapse.

---

### **Question 6**

**(a) Write the names of the coal fields in Bangladesh. What is the unit for measuring the calorific value of coal?** (3.5 Marks)

**Answer:**

1.  Barapukuria Coal Field, Dinajpur
2.  Phulbari Coal Field, Dinajpur
3.  Dighipara Coal Field, Dinajpur
4.  Khalashpir Coal Field, Rangpur
5.  Jamalganj Coal Field, Joypurhat

The unit for measuring the calorific value (heating value) of coal is typically **kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg)** or **Joules per kilogram (J/kg)** in the metric system. The British Thermal Unit per pound (BTU/lb) is also commonly used.

---

**(b) Give a brief description of the uses of natural gas.** (2 Marks)

**Answer:**
Natural gas is a versatile and cleaner-burning fossil fuel with numerous uses:
*   **Electricity Generation:** It is a major fuel for power plants to generate electricity.
*   **Residential Use:** Used for cooking, water heating, and space heating in homes.
*   **Industrial Use:** Used as a heat source for various industrial processes and as a chemical feedstock to produce plastics, fertilizers, and other chemicals.
*   **Transportation Fuel:** Used in the form of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as a cleaner fuel for vehicles.

---

**(c) What is a black hole?** (1 Mark)

**Answer:**
A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It is formed from the remnant of a massive star that collapses under its own gravity at the end of its life. The boundary beyond which escape is impossible is called the **event horizon**.

---

### **Question 7**

**(a) What is the total mass of the atmosphere?** (1 Mark)

**Answer:**
The total mass of the Earth's atmosphere is approximately **5.15 x 10¹⁸ kg**.

---

**(b) Write the names of the components of the atmosphere mentioning their percentages.** (2.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
The composition of dry air in the atmosphere by volume is:
*   **Nitrogen (N₂):** 78.08%
*   **Oxygen (O₂):** 20.95%
*   **Argon (Ar):** 0.93%
*   **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** ~0.04%
*   **Trace Gases:** Small amounts of Neon (Ne), Helium (He), Methane (CH₄), Krypton (Kr), and Hydrogen (H₂).

---

**(c) Discuss the importance of the troposphere for the environment.** (2 Marks)

**Answer:**
The troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere, is vitally important for the environment:
1.  **Contains Breathable Air:** It contains the majority of the atmosphere's mass and the oxygen necessary for respiration for most life on Earth.
2.  **Site of All Weather:** It contains almost all the atmospheric water vapor, leading to the formation of clouds, rain, storms, and all other weather phenomena that are essential for ecosystems and agriculture.
3.  **Regulates Temperature:** It traps heat via the natural greenhouse effect, keeping the Earth's surface at a habitable temperature.

---

**(d) What is a wildfire?** (2 Marks)

**Answer:**
A wildfire is any large, unplanned, and uncontrolled fire that spreads rapidly through an area of combustible vegetation, such as a forest, grassland, or scrubland. Wildfires can be started by natural causes like lightning strikes or by human activities, either accidentally (e.g., unattended campfires) or intentionally (arson). They are particularly dangerous and difficult to control in hot, dry, and windy conditions.

---

### **Question 8**

**(a) Would any problem arise if the wavelength of sound were equal to the wavelength of white light?** (2 Marks)

**Answer:**
No direct physical problem would arise because sound and light are fundamentally different types of waves. Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium, while light is an electromagnetic wave that does not. They interact with matter in completely different ways. However, this is a purely hypothetical scenario. For a sound wave to have a wavelength as short as light (400-700 nm), its frequency would have to be extraordinarily high (in the terahertz range), far beyond what can be produced or perceived as sound.

---

**(b) How can a lens be identified without any instrument?** (2 Marks)

**Answer:**
A lens can be identified using a simple observation method:
1.  Hold the lens close to a piece of printed text.
2.  If the letters appear **magnified** (larger), the lens is a **convex lens**.
3.  If the letters appear **diminished** (smaller), the lens is a **concave lens**.
Alternatively, if you move the lens up and down, a convex lens will show objects moving against your hand's motion, while a concave lens will show them moving with your hand's motion.

---

**(c) Define total internal reflection. Write a short note on mirages.** (3.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
**Total Internal Reflection (TIR):** It is an optical phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light, traveling from a denser medium to a less dense medium, is completely reflected back into the denser medium. This only happens if the angle of incidence (the angle at which the light strikes the boundary) is greater than a specific value known as the **critical angle**.

**Short Note on Mirages:**
A mirage is a naturally occurring optical illusion caused by the bending (refraction) of light rays as they pass through layers of air at different temperatures and densities. On a hot day, the air near the ground is much hotter and less dense than the cooler air above it. Light rays from a distant object (like the sky or a tree) traveling towards the ground are bent upwards as they enter the less dense hot air. An observer sees these bent rays and perceives them as coming from the ground, creating a shimmering, inverted image that looks like a reflection in a pool of water.

### **Question 9**

**(a) Write the differences between radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Write the side effects of both therapies.** (3.5 Marks)

**Answer:**
**Differences:**

| Feature | Radiotherapy | Chemotherapy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Method** | Uses high-energy radiation (e.g., X-rays) to kill cancer cells. | Uses cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer cells. |
| **Scope** | **Local treatment:** Targets a specific tumor or area of the body. | **Systemic treatment:** Drugs travel through the bloodstream, affecting the entire body. |

**Side Effects:**
*   **Radiotherapy:** Side effects are generally confined to the treated area and may include fatigue, skin reactions (redness, soreness), and hair loss *only* in the specific area being treated.
*   **Chemotherapy:** Side effects are more widespread and can include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hair loss (all over the body), mouth sores, and an increased risk of infection due to a lowered white blood cell count.

---

**(b) All enzymes are proteins but all proteins are not enzymes - explain.** (2 Marks)

**Answer:**
This statement describes the relationship between enzymes and proteins.
*   **"All enzymes are proteins":** Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. Their catalytic function depends on a highly specific three-dimensional shape, which is a characteristic of globular proteins. (A small exception exists: some RNA molecules called ribozymes can also act as catalysts, but the vast majority of enzymes are proteins).
*   **"All proteins are not enzymes":** Proteins are a diverse class of macromolecules with a vast array of functions beyond catalysis. Many proteins serve other vital roles, such as:
    *   **Structural:** Collagen in skin, keratin in hair.
    *   **Transport:** Hemoglobin carrying oxygen.
    *   **Immune Defense:** Antibodies fighting infection.
    *   **Movement:** Actin and myosin in muscles.
Therefore, while being a catalyst (an enzyme) is one function of a protein, it is not the only one.

---

**(c) Why is red color used for danger signals?** (2 Marks)

**Answer:**
Red color is used for danger signals primarily because of its optical properties related to light scattering.
1.  **Longest Wavelength:** Red light has the longest wavelength of all the colors in the visible spectrum.
2.  **Least Scattering:** According to Rayleigh's Law of Scattering, light with longer wavelengths is scattered the least by particles in the atmosphere (like fog, rain, dust, or smoke).
Because it scatters less, red light can travel the farthest through the air and remain visible from a long distance, even in poor weather conditions. This makes it the most effective color for conveying critical information like "stop" or "danger" reliably.

**Explanation of the Central Processing Unit (CPU):**
The CPU is often called the "brain" of the computer, as it is responsible for executing instructions and processing data. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and then performs the required operations. The CPU consists of three main components:

1.  **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** This unit performs all the computational tasks. It handles:
    *   **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    *   **Logical Operations:** Comparisons like AND, OR, NOT, and checking if one value is greater than, less than, or equal to another.

2.  **Control Unit (CU):** This unit acts as the nerve center of the computer. It does not process data itself but directs and coordinates the activities of all other components. It fetches instructions from memory, interprets them, and generates control signals to execute them.

3.  **Registers:** These are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU. They are used to temporarily hold data, instructions, and memory addresses that are being actively used by the CPU, allowing for very fast access and processing.

---

**(b) What are the main functions of an operating system? Name two popular operating systems. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an intermediary between the computer hardware and the user. Its main functions are:

1.  **Process Management:** It manages the execution of programs (processes), scheduling which process gets to use the CPU and for how long.
2.  **Memory Management:** It allocates and de-allocates memory space to programs and data as needed, ensuring that processes do not interfere with each other's memory.
3.  **File Management:** It organizes files and directories on storage devices, controlling their creation, deletion, access, and security.
4.  **Device (I/O) Management:** It manages all input/output devices (like keyboards, printers, disk drives) by communicating with them through device drivers.
5.  **Security:** It provides security by controlling access to the system and its resources through mechanisms like user accounts and passwords.
6.  **User Interface:** It provides a way for the user to interact with the computer, either through a Command-Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

**Two popular operating systems are:**
1.  Microsoft Windows
2.  macOS (or Linux / Android)

**(d) How does a Database Management System (DBMS) play an effective role in modern banking? (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
A DBMS is critical to the functioning of modern banks. It plays an effective role in the following ways:

1.  **Centralized Data Management:** A DBMS manages all customer information, account details, and transaction histories in a centralized, secure, and organized manner.
2.  **Transaction Integrity (ACID Properties):** It ensures that financial transactions (like fund transfers or withdrawals) are processed with **A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation, and **D**urability. This guarantees that transactions are either completed successfully or not at all, preventing errors and data corruption.
3.  **Data Security:** It provides robust security features, including user authentication and access controls, to protect sensitive financial data from unauthorized access.
4.  **Concurrent Access:** It allows thousands of users (tellers, ATMs, online banking customers) to access and update data simultaneously without conflicts.
5.  **Backup and Recovery:** It provides reliable mechanisms for backing up data and recovering it quickly in case of a system failure, ensuring business continuity.

**(e) In computer networking, what is meant by bandwidth? What is its unit? (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Bandwidth:**
In computer networking, bandwidth refers to the **maximum data transfer capacity** of a network connection over a specific period. It represents the highest possible rate at which data can be sent through a network path. It is often compared to the width of a pipe: a wider pipe (higher bandwidth) can carry more water (data) at once. While bandwidth is the theoretical maximum, the actual data transfer rate is called **throughput**, which can be lower due to factors like network congestion and latency.

**Unit of Bandwidth:**
The fundamental unit of bandwidth is **bits per second (bps)**. Due to the high speeds of modern networks, larger units are commonly used:
*   **Kbps** (Kilobits per second) = 1,000 bps
*   **Mbps** (Megabits per second) = 1,000,000 bps
*   **Gbps** (Gigabits per second) = 1,000,000,000 bps

**(b) What are the full forms of UPS and IPS? What is the difference between them? How does a voltage stabilizer work? (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Full Forms:**
*   **UPS:** Uninterruptible Power Supply
*   **IPS:** Instantaneous Power Supply (or more commonly, Inverter Power System)

**Difference between UPS and IPS:**
The main difference is the **switching time**.
*   An **Online UPS** provides continuous power from its battery through an inverter, so there is **zero switching time** during a power outage. This is essential for sensitive devices like computers.
*   An **IPS** powers devices directly from the mains and only switches to battery power when the mains fail. This results in a **brief delay** (a few milliseconds), which is fine for lights and fans but can cause a computer to restart.

**How a Voltage Stabilizer Works:**
A voltage stabilizer maintains a constant output voltage despite fluctuations in the input voltage. It uses an autotransformer with multiple taps. A control circuit monitors the output voltage and, if it deviates, uses relays to switch to a different tap on the transformer to either "boost" (increase) or "buck" (decrease) the voltage, thus keeping the output stable.

**(c) What is the difference between AC voltage and DC voltage? Give two examples of each. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Difference:**

| Feature | AC (Alternating Current) Voltage | DC (Direct Current) Voltage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction** | The direction of current flow periodically reverses. | The current flows constantly in one direction. |
| **Waveform** | Typically a sine wave. | A straight, constant line. |
| **Source** | Generated by alternators in power plants. | Produced by batteries, solar cells, power adapters. |

**Examples:**
*   **AC Voltage:**
    1.  Household electrical outlets (220V).
    2.  Power from a power plant generator.
*   **DC Voltage:**
    1.  A standard AA battery (1.5V).
    2.  The output of a laptop charger.

**(d) Why is nuclear waste disposal risky and expensive? Explain. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Nuclear waste disposal is risky and expensive for two primary reasons: its hazardous nature and the complexity of its containment.

*   **Risks (Hazardous Nature):**
    1.  **High Radioactivity:** Spent nuclear fuel is intensely radioactive and remains dangerous for thousands of years. Exposure can cause cancer, genetic damage, and death.
    2.  **Environmental Contamination:** If radioactive material leaks, it can contaminate soil and water for vast areas, entering the food chain and posing a long-term threat to ecosystems and human health.

*   **Expenses (Costly Process):**
    1.  **Specialized Containment:** The waste must be encased in multiple, highly durable layers (e.g., vitrified into glass, sealed in steel casks) to prevent leaks for millennia.
    2.  **Deep Geological Disposal:** The internationally accepted solution is to bury the waste in stable geological repositories hundreds of meters underground. The cost of identifying a suitable site, construction, and operation is enormous, running into billions of dollars.
    3.  **Long-term Security and Monitoring:** The disposal site must be guarded and monitored for centuries to ensure its integrity, adding to the immense long-term cost.

**(e) Explain the process of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The process of delivering electricity from a power plant to a consumer involves three main stages:

1.  **Generation:** Electricity is produced in power plants, typically by rotating a turbine connected to a generator. The turbine can be spun by steam (from burning coal/gas or nuclear fission), falling water (hydropower), or wind. The generator converts this mechanical energy into electrical energy at a moderate voltage.

2.  **Transmission:** To transport electricity efficiently over long distances, its voltage is increased to very high levels (e.g., 230,000 Volts) using a **step-up transformer**. Transmitting at high voltage and low current minimizes power loss (I²R loss) in the transmission lines. This high-voltage electricity is carried across the country by large transmission towers.

3.  **Distribution:** Near towns and cities, a **step-down transformer** at a substation reduces the high voltage to a lower, safer level for local distribution. This power is then sent through smaller distribution lines. Finally, a pole-mounted or pad-mounted transformer near homes and businesses steps the voltage down again to the standard level used by consumers (e.g., 220V), completing the delivery process.
