**(b) Write the uses of the DNA test. (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
The uses of a DNA test are diverse and significant:
1.  **Forensic Science:** To identify suspects by matching DNA from a crime scene with a database or a suspect's DNA.
2.  **Paternity/Maternity Testing:** To establish biological relationships between individuals, such as determining a child's father or mother.
3.  **Identification of Remains:** To identify deceased individuals, especially in cases of accidents, natural disasters, or when the body is unrecognizable.
4.  **Medical Diagnosis:** To diagnose genetic disorders and determine an individual's predisposition to certain hereditary diseases.

---

**(c) Explain how the method adopted by the authorities in the given scenario will be accomplished. (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
The method adopted by the authorities is **DNA profiling** (or DNA fingerprinting). It will be accomplished through the following steps:
1.  **Sample Collection:** A biological sample (such as tissue, blood, or bone) is collected from the deceased person's body. Simultaneously, DNA samples are collected from the potential relatives (e.g., from a cheek swab).
2.  **DNA Extraction:** DNA is extracted from the cells in all the collected samples in a laboratory.
3.  **DNA Amplification:** A technique called **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)** is used to make millions of copies of specific, highly variable regions of the DNA, known as Short Tandem Repeats (STRs).
4.  **DNA Analysis:** The amplified DNA fragments are separated by size using gel electrophoresis. This creates a unique pattern of bands for each individual, which is their "DNA profile".
5.  **Comparison:** The DNA profile of the deceased is compared to the profiles of the relatives. Since a person inherits half of their DNA from each parent, the profiles will show specific, predictable matches if they are related. A conclusive match confirms the identity of the deceased.

### **Question 3**

**(a) Discuss the causes and effects of global warming. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Causes:** The primary cause is the **enhanced greenhouse effect**, driven by the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere from human activities. This includes:
    *   Burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) for energy, releasing carbon dioxide (CO₂).
    *   Deforestation, which reduces the Earth's ability to absorb CO₂.
    *   Agricultural practices that release methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O).
*   **Effects:**
    *   **Rising Temperatures:** An increase in the average global temperature.
    *   **Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels:** Threatening coastal communities.
    *   **Extreme Weather:** Increased frequency of heatwaves, floods, droughts, and powerful storms.
    *   **Loss of Biodiversity:** Disruption of ecosystems and extinction of species.

---

**(b) Discuss whether any particular type of paddy cultivation method is responsible for global warming. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Yes, the traditional method of **flooded paddy (rice) cultivation** is a significant contributor to global warming.
*   **Mechanism:** Rice is typically grown in fields that are flooded with water for a large part of the growing season. This waterlogged condition creates an anaerobic (oxygen-poor) environment in the soil.
*   **Methane Production:** In this anaerobic soil, specific types of microbes (methanogens) decompose the organic matter and produce **methane (CH₄)** as a byproduct.
*   **Impact:** Methane is a greenhouse gas that is over 25 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. The methane produced in these flooded paddy fields escapes into the atmosphere, contributing significantly to the overall greenhouse effect and global warming.

---

**(c) Discuss the role of zinc-rich food in the human body. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Zinc is an essential trace mineral that plays several vital roles in the human body:
1.  **Immune Function:** Zinc is crucial for the normal development and function of immune cells. A deficiency can impair the immune system, making a person more susceptible to infections.
2.  **Wound Healing:** It plays a key role in cell growth, protein synthesis, and collagen formation, which are necessary for repairing tissues and healing wounds.
3.  **Sense of Taste and Smell:** Zinc is essential for maintaining a proper sense of taste and smell.

*   **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids):** TDS is the total concentration of all dissolved substances (minerals, salts, and organic matter) in water.

---

**(b) Discuss the importance of pH and PF of soil in crop production. (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Importance of pH:** Soil pH is a master variable that affects the **availability of essential nutrients** for plants. Most crops grow best in a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. If the soil is too acidic (low pH) or too alkaline (high pH), key nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium can become "locked up" and unavailable for plant roots to absorb, even if they are present in the soil. Extreme pH can also lead to the toxicity of elements like aluminum.
*   **Importance of PF:** PF is a measure of **soil water potential** or how tightly water is held in the soil. It is crucial because it determines how easily plant roots can extract water from the soil. A proper PF value ensures that plants have access to sufficient moisture for growth without being waterlogged or facing drought stress.

---

**(c) Discuss the importance of freshwater in protecting the environment. (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
Freshwater is fundamental to protecting and maintaining the environment:
1.  **Supports Ecosystems:** Freshwater bodies like rivers, lakes, and wetlands are critical habitats for a vast array of plants and animals, forming the base of many ecosystems and food webs.
2.  **Maintains Biodiversity:** The health and availability of freshwater sources are essential for sustaining biodiversity, both aquatic and terrestrial.
3.  **Nutrient Cycling:** Water is the primary medium for transporting nutrients through ecosystems, a process vital for the health of forests and agricultural lands.
4.  **Climate Regulation:** Large freshwater bodies can influence local weather patterns and contribute to the global water cycle, which helps regulate the Earth's climate.

**(c) Discuss the importance of the reaction of acid and alkali in daily life. (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
The reaction of acids and alkalis (bases), known as **neutralization**, is important in daily life:
1.  **Treating Indigestion:** Antacids, which are weak bases (like magnesium hydroxide), are used to neutralize excess stomach acid and relieve heartburn.
2.  **Agriculture:** Farmers add lime (a base) to acidic soil to neutralize it and make it more suitable for growing crops.
3.  **Treating Stings:** The sting of a bee is acidic and can be neutralized by applying a weak base like baking soda. The sting of a wasp is alkaline and can be neutralized by a weak acid like vinegar.

---

**(d) Explain the cause of your stomach pain in the given scenario. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
In the given scenario, the stomach pain from drinking excessive soft drinks is likely caused by two main factors:
1.  **High Acidity:** Most soft drinks are highly acidic, primarily due to the presence of **carbonic acid** (from dissolved CO₂) and **phosphoric acid**. Consuming these in large quantities can irritate the sensitive lining of the stomach and esophagus, leading to inflammation and pain.
2.  **High Sugar Content:** The large amount of sugar in soft drinks can cause rapid fermentation by gut bacteria, leading to the production of excess gas, which can cause bloating, cramping, and stomach pain.

---

### **Question 6**

**(a) What measures can be taken to increase the strength of the magnetic field created in a solenoid? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The strength of the magnetic field inside a solenoid can be increased in three main ways:
1.  **Increase the Current:** The magnetic field strength is directly proportional to the electric current flowing through the coil. Increasing the current will increase the field strength.
2.  **Increase the Number of Turns:** Increasing the number of turns (loops) of wire per unit length of the solenoid will concentrate the magnetic field, making it stronger.
3.  **Insert an Iron Core:** Placing a soft iron core inside the solenoid dramatically increases the magnetic field strength. The iron becomes strongly magnetized, and its magnetic field adds to the field of the coil.

---

**(b) Mention how electromagnetic induction works in a transformer. (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
A transformer works on the principle of mutual electromagnetic induction:
1.  An **alternating current (AC)** flowing through the primary coil creates a continuously changing magnetic field in the shared iron core.
2.  According to Faraday's Law of Induction, this **changing magnetic field** that passes through the secondary coil induces an alternating voltage (and thus a current) in the secondary coil.
It's crucial that the current is AC, as a DC current would create a constant magnetic field that cannot induce a current in the secondary coil.

---

**(c) For a given temperature, which of two wires of the same material, one thick and one thin, will conduct more electricity and why? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The **thick wire** will conduct more electricity.
**Reason:**
Electrical resistance is **inversely proportional** to the cross-sectional area of a conductor. A thick wire has a larger cross-sectional area than a thin wire of the same material. This larger area provides more pathways for the electrons to flow, resulting in **lower resistance**. According to Ohm's Law (I = V/R), for a given voltage, a lower resistance will allow a higher current (more electricity) to flow.

---

### **Question 7**

**Scenario:** *Two workers in a ship-breaking industry have been suffering from various physical problems including coughing and chest pain for a long time. Upon examination, it was found that the cell division in one worker's respiratory organ has become uncontrolled. The other worker's disease has spread beyond the respiratory organ to the intestines and bones.*

**(a) Explain Benign and Malignant. (1 mark)**

**Answer:**
*   **Benign:** A benign tumor is a non-cancerous growth. Its cells do not spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, and while it can grow large, it is usually not life-threatening.
*   **Malignant:** A malignant tumor is cancerous. Its cells grow uncontrollably and can invade nearby tissues and spread to distant parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system (metastasis).

---

**(b) Write the names of the two diseases of the respiratory organs of the two workers. (1 mark)**

**Answer:**
Based on the scenario and the common risks in the ship-breaking industry (exposure to asbestos), the diseases are likely:
*   **Worker 1 (uncontrolled cell division):** Lung Cancer
*   **Worker 2 (spread to intestines and bones):** Metastatic Lung Cancer (cancer that originated in the lungs and has spread). Another possibility is Mesothelioma, a cancer caused by asbestos exposure.

---

**(c) Between the diseases of the two workers, which one is relatively easier to cure and why? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The disease of the **first worker (uncontrolled cell division in the respiratory organ)** is relatively easier to cure.
**Reason:**
This disease is described as being localized ("in the respiratory organ"). A localized, non-metastatic tumor (like a benign tumor or early-stage lung cancer) can often be treated more effectively. It may be possible to completely remove the tumor through surgery or target it precisely with radiation therapy. The disease of the second worker has already **metastasized** (spread to other organs), making it much more difficult to treat and cure, as the cancer cells are present throughout the body.

---

**(d) Discuss the symptoms, prevention, and control of a person affected by the Zika virus. (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Symptoms:** Many people with Zika virus have no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are usually mild and include fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis (red eyes), and headache.
*   **Prevention:** The primary method of prevention is to avoid bites from the **Aedes mosquito**, which transmits the virus. This includes:
    *   Using insect repellent.
    *   Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.
    *   Eliminating stagnant water where mosquitoes breed.
    *   Using condoms, as Zika can also be transmitted sexually.
*   **Control:** There is no specific treatment for Zika. Control focuses on managing symptoms, such as getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to prevent dehydration, and taking medicine like paracetamol to reduce fever and pain.

---

**(c) What are Moist deciduous, dry deciduous, and wet deciduous forests? (1 mark)**

**Answer:**
*   **Moist Deciduous Forest:** A type of forest that experiences significant rainfall and has trees that shed their leaves during the dry season, but for a shorter period.
*   **Dry Deciduous Forest:** A forest found in areas with less rainfall, where trees shed their leaves for a longer period during the dry season to conserve water.
*   **Wet Deciduous Forest:** This is not a standard forestry classification. The question likely means "Wet Evergreen Forest" or is referring to a variation of moist deciduous forest. A wet evergreen forest receives very high rainfall and its trees remain green year-round.

---

**(d) Discuss the importance of a Rain forest. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
Rainforests are vitally important for the planet:
1.  **Incredible Biodiversity:** They are home to more than half of the world's plant and animal species, making them the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth.

1.  **Ecosystem Services:** Biodiversity provides essential services that support human life, such as pollination of crops, soil formation, water purification, and climate regulation.
2.  **Economic Value:** It provides direct economic benefits through resources for food, medicine, and industrial products. Ecotourism is also a significant source of income.
3.  **Ethical and Aesthetic Reasons:** Many people believe that every species has an intrinsic right to exist, and a diverse natural world provides immense aesthetic, cultural, and recreational value.
4.  **Ecosystem Resilience:** A diverse ecosystem is more resilient and stable, better able to withstand disturbances like climate change or disease outbreaks.

---

**(b) What are the threats to tiger conservation in Bangladesh? (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
The main threats to the conservation of the Bengal tiger in Bangladesh (primarily in the Sundarbans) are:
*   **Poaching:** Illegal hunting of tigers for their skin, bones, and other body parts, which are in high demand in the illegal international wildlife trade.
*   **Habitat Loss and Degradation:** The mangrove forest habitat is shrinking due to climate change (sea-level rise), increased salinity, and human encroachment.
*   **Human-Tiger Conflict:** As human settlements expand, tigers may prey on livestock, leading to retaliatory killings by villagers.
*   **Prey Depletion:** A decline in the population of prey animals, like deer, due to poaching and habitat loss.

---

**(c) What is meant by a Community Conserved Area (CCA)? (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
A Community Conserved Area (CCA) is a natural area or ecosystem where a local or indigenous community takes the primary role in governing, managing, and conserving the biodiversity and natural resources. Unlike traditional protected areas managed by the government, in a CCA, the conservation efforts are driven by the community's own rules, traditions, and institutions. This approach recognizes the deep connection and traditional knowledge that local communities have with their environment.

---

**(d) What is meant by Renewable resource? (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
A renewable resource is a natural resource that can be replenished naturally over a short period of time, making it sustainable for use. It is essentially inexhaustible on a human timescale.

---

**(4) Briefly describe how cache memory works with a diagram. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**How it Works:** Cache memory is a small, extremely fast memory that sits between the CPU and the main memory (RAM). It stores copies of the data and instructions that are most frequently used by the CPU. When the CPU needs data, it first checks the cache. If the data is there (a "cache hit"), it can be retrieved much faster than going to the slower RAM. If the data is not there (a "cache miss"), the CPU retrieves it from RAM and also places a copy in the cache for future use. This process significantly speeds up the computer's performance.

**Simplified Diagram:**
```
+-------+   <-- Very Fast -->   +-------------+   <-- Slower -->   +----------+
|  CPU  | <-------------------> | Cache Memory| <----------------> |    RAM   |
+-------+                       +-------------+                    +----------+
```

    *   **Example:** A traditional telephone call. The line is dedicated to your conversation until you hang up.
*   **Packet Switching:** Data is broken down into small blocks called packets. Each packet is sent independently through the network and may take a different route to the destination. The packets are reassembled at the destination.
    *   **Example:** The internet. Data you send or receive (like an email or web page) is broken into packets and sent across the network.
