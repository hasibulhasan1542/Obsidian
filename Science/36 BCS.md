    - **Forensic Science:** Identifying individuals from biological samples (blood, hair, semen) found at crime scenes.
    - **Paternity/Maternity Testing:** Determining biological relationships between individuals.
    - **Medical Diagnosis:** Identifying genetic predisposition to certain diseases.
    - **Identification:** Identifying victims of disasters or accidents when bodies are unrecognizable.
    - **Genealogy:** Tracing ancestry and family history.

_(c) Explain how the method adopted by the authorities in the stimulus will be completed. (2 Marks)_

- The authorities likely used **DNA fingerprinting** (also known as DNA profiling). This process involves:
    1. **Sample Collection:** Collecting DNA samples from the unidentified bodies (e.g., from tissue, bone, or blood) and potential relatives.
    2. **DNA Extraction:** Isolating DNA from the collected samples.
    3. **Analysis:** Analyzing specific, highly variable regions of the DNA (like Short Tandem Repeats - STRs). Techniques like PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplify these regions, and gel electrophoresis separates the DNA fragments based on size.
    4. **Comparison:** Comparing the DNA profiles generated from the bodies with those of the potential relatives. Close relatives share a significant portion of their DNA profile. Matching profiles confirm the identity.

_(d) Explain the benefits of the mentioned technology. (3 Marks)_

- The benefits of DNA technology (specifically DNA fingerprinting/testing) include:
    - **Accurate Identification:** Provides a highly accurate method for identifying individuals, even from degraded or minimal biological samples, crucial in forensics and disaster victim identification.
    - **Resolving Paternity/Kinship:** Conclusively establishes biological relationships, settling legal and personal disputes.

    - **Regulation & Enforcement:** Strict government monitoring and action against illegal use.
    - **Public Awareness:** Educating consumers and vendors about the dangers.
    - **Seeking Medical Help:** If poisoning is suspected, immediate medical attention is required.

**3. Global Warming and Agriculture**

_(a) Discuss the causes and effects of global warming. (2.5 Marks)_

- **Causes:** Global warming is primarily caused by the enhanced greenhouse effect due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Key causes include:
    - **Burning Fossil Fuels:** Combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2​).
    - **Deforestation:** Trees absorb CO2​; their removal reduces this capacity and releases stored carbon.
    - **Industrial Processes:** Various industrial activities release GHGs like methane (CH4​), nitrous oxide (N2​O), and fluorinated gases.
    - **Agriculture:** Practices like rice cultivation (methane), livestock farming (methane), and fertilizer use (nitrous oxide) contribute significantly.
- **Effects:**
    - **Rising Temperatures:** Increase in average global air and ocean temperatures.
    - **Climate Change:** More frequent and intense heatwaves, changes in precipitation patterns (floods, droughts), stronger storms.
    - **Sea Level Rise:** Melting glaciers and polar ice caps, thermal expansion of seawater, leading to coastal flooding.
    - **Ocean Acidification:** Increased CO2​ absorption by oceans makes them more acidic, harming marine ecosystems (coral reefs, shellfish).
    - **Impacts on Ecosystems:** Shifts in habitats, biodiversity loss, extinction risks.

_(b) Discuss whether a particular type of rice cultivation method is responsible for global warming. (2.5 Marks)_

- Yes, traditional **flooded rice paddy cultivation** is a significant source of methane (CH4​), a potent greenhouse gas. The waterlogged, anaerobic (oxygen-poor) conditions in flooded paddies allow methane-producing microbes (methanogens) to thrive, decomposing organic matter in the soil and releasing CH4​ into the atmosphere. While rice is a vital food staple, alternative cultivation methods like the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) or alternate wetting and drying (AWD) can significantly reduce methane emissions by introducing aerobic periods into the soil.

_(c) Discuss the role of zinc-rich food in the human body. (2.5 Marks)_

- Zinc is an essential trace mineral vital for numerous bodily functions:
    - **Immune Function:** Crucial for the development and function of immune cells; deficiency impairs immunity.

    - **Wound Healing:** Plays a key role in tissue repair and skin health.
    - **Enzyme Function:** Acts as a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes involved in metabolism, digestion, nerve function, etc.
    - **Sense of Taste and Smell:** Necessary for proper functioning of these senses.
    - **DNA Synthesis:** Involved in the creation of genetic material.
    - Zinc-rich foods include oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, whole grains, and fortified cereals.

**4. Water Quality and Environment**

_(a) What are BOD and TDS of water? (1 Mark)_

- **BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand):** The amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a2 given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period3 (usually 5 days at 20°C). It's an indicator of the level of organic pollution. High BOD means more oxygen is required, indicating lower water quality.
- **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids):** The total amount of mobile charged ions, including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in a given volume4 of water, expressed in units5 like milligrams per liter (mg/L) or parts per million (ppm). TDS includes inorganic salts (calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, sulfates) and small amounts of organic matter.

_(b) Discuss the importance of soil pH and pF in crop production. (2 Marks)_

- **Soil pH:** Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the soil.
    - **Importance:** Soil pH critically affects nutrient availability to plants. Different nutrients are soluble and available at different pH levels. Most crops prefer a slightly acidic to neutral pH (around 6.0-7.0) for optimal nutrient uptake. Extreme pH (too acidic or too alkaline) can lock up essential nutrients or increase the toxicity of elements like aluminum. It also influences soil microbial activity.
- **Soil pF (Potential Force):** Measures soil moisture tension or how tightly water is held by soil particles. It's related to the energy plants must exert to extract water.
    - **Importance:** Indicates the availability of water to plants. High pF means water is held tightly (dry soil), while low pF means water is readily available (wet soil). Understanding pF helps in irrigation management – knowing when and how much to water to avoid water stress (pF too high) or waterlogging (pF too low) for optimal crop growth.

_(c) Discuss the importance of freshwater in environmental protection. (2.5 Marks)_

- Freshwater (lakes, rivers, groundwater) is vital for environmental protection:
    - **Habitat:** Supports diverse aquatic ecosystems and terrestrial wildlife that depend on freshwater sources for drinking and habitat.
    - **Biodiversity:** Freshwater ecosystems harbor a significant portion of global biodiversity. Protecting water quality and quantity protects these species.
    - **Ecosystem Services:** Wetlands and riparian zones filter pollutants, recharge groundwater, control floods, and support nutrient cycling.
    - **Climate Regulation:** Large water bodies influence local and regional climates.
    - **Maintaining Ecological Balance:** Adequate freshwater flow is necessary to prevent saltwater intrusion in coastal areas and maintain the health of estuaries. Protecting freshwater resources from pollution and overuse is crucial for overall environmental health.

_(d) What reaction does DDT create in the human body? (1 Mark)_

- DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is a persistent organic pollutant. In the human body, it acts as a suspected endocrine disruptor (interfering with hormones) and potential carcinogen. Acute high exposure can cause neurological symptoms like tremors, seizures, and vomiting. Chronic exposure is linked to developmental and reproductive problems, liver damage, and increased risk of certain cancers. It accumulates in fatty tissues and biomagnifies up the food chain.

**5. Acids and Bases**

_(Scenario: You feel stomach pain after drinking too many soft drinks, as diagnosed by a doctor.)_

_(a) Define acid and base according to the electronic theory. (1 Mark)_

- According to the Lewis electronic theory:
    - **Acid:** A Lewis acid is any species (molecule or ion) that can **accept** a pair of electrons.
    - **Base:** A Lewis base is any species (molecule or ion) that can **donate** a pair of electrons.

_(b) Name two indicators and mention the color they show in acidic and basic mediums. (2 Marks)_

    - **Digestion:** Hydrochloric acid in the stomach helps digest food; antacids (bases) neutralize excess stomach acid to relieve heartburn.
    - **Cleaning:** Soaps and detergents are often alkaline (basic) to help remove grease and dirt. Acidic cleaners are used to remove mineral deposits (like limescale).
    - **Food:** Acids (like vinegar, citric acid) are used as preservatives and flavour enhancers. Bases (like baking soda) are used as leavening agents in baking.
    - **Agriculture:** Adjusting soil pH using lime (base) or sulfur (acidifies) for optimal plant growth.
    - **Health:** Maintaining the body's strict pH balance in blood and tissues is vital for survival, involving buffer systems (weak acids/bases).

_(d) Explain the cause of your stomach pain in the scenario. (2.5 Marks)_

- The stomach pain mentioned in the scenario after drinking excessive soft drinks is likely caused by:
    - **Acidity:** Soft drinks are generally acidic (due to carbonic acid from dissolved CO2​, and often phosphoric acid or citric acid). Consuming large amounts can increase the overall acidity in the stomach, potentially irritating the stomach lining and causing pain or heartburn.
    - **Gas/Bloating:** The carbonation (CO2​ gas) in soft drinks can lead to gas buildup and bloating in the stomach and intestines, causing discomfort and pain.
    - **Sugar Content:** High sugar content in many soft drinks can also contribute to digestive discomfort for some individuals.

**8. Forests and Biodiversity (Bangladesh Context)**

_(a) What is the area of the Sundarbans in the Bangladesh part? (1 Mark)_

- The area of the Sundarbans mangrove forest within Bangladesh is approximately 6,017 square kilometers. (Note: Figures can vary slightly depending on the source and measurement methods).

_(b) What are pneumatophores (breathing roots)? (1 Mark)_

- Pneumatophores, or breathing roots, are specialized aerial roots found in some mangrove species (like in the Sundarbans) that grow upwards from the waterlogged, oxygen-poor mud into the air. These roots have pores (lenticels) that allow the plant to absorb oxygen directly from the atmosphere, which is essential for respiration as the underground roots cannot get enough oxygen from the anaerobic soil.

_(c) What are Moist deciduous, dry deciduous, and wet deciduous forests? (3 Marks)_

- These terms classify deciduous forests (forests where trees shed their leaves seasonally) based on rainfall and moisture levels:
    - **Moist Deciduous Forest:** Receives relatively high annual rainfall (typically 100-200 cm). Trees shed leaves in the dry season, but the period is shorter, and the forest remains relatively moist. These forests are dense with a variety of species. Examples in Bangladesh include Sal forests in certain areas.
    - **Dry Deciduous Forest:** Receives lower annual rainfall (typically 70-100 cm) with a longer and more pronounced dry season. Trees shed leaves for a longer period to conserve water. The forest is less dense than moist deciduous forests.
    - **Wet Deciduous Forest:** This term is less standard than the others. It might refer to deciduous forests in very high rainfall areas where deciduousness is still driven by factors other than just drought (e.g., photoperiod), or it could be used interchangeably with moist deciduous in some contexts. More commonly, very high rainfall areas support evergreen or semi-evergreen forests. _(Self-correction: Standard classification usually contrasts Moist and Dry Deciduous. "Wet Deciduous" might be regional or less common terminology. Focus on Moist vs. Dry.)_

_(d) Discuss the importance of Rainforests. (2.5 Marks)_

- Rainforests (typically tropical rainforests) are immensely important:
    - **Biodiversity Hotspots:** They harbor the highest concentration of terrestrial biodiversity on Earth, providing habitats for millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms.
    - **Climate Regulation:** Play a crucial role in regulating global and regional climates by absorbing vast amounts of carbon dioxide (acting as "carbon sinks"), releasing oxygen, and influencing rainfall patterns through transpiration.
    - **Water Cycle:** Significantly contribute to the water cycle, maintaining hydrological balance.
    - **Source of Resources:** Provide valuable resources like timber, medicinal plants, food (fruits, nuts), and genetic resources.
    - **Indigenous Cultures:** Home to many indigenous communities whose cultures and livelihoods are deeply connected to the forest.

**9. Biodiversity Conservation**

_(a) Discuss the importance of Biodiversity conservation. (2 Marks)_

- Biodiversity conservation is crucial because:
    - **Ecosystem Stability:** Diverse ecosystems are more resilient to environmental changes and disturbances. Each species plays a role in ecosystem functioning (pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control).
    - **Ecosystem Services:** Biodiversity underpins essential services humans rely on, such as clean air and water, soil fertility, climate regulation, pollination, and flood control.
    - **Economic Benefits:** Provides resources for food, medicine, timber, tourism, and genetic resources for agriculture and biotechnology.
    - **Ethical/Aesthetic Value:** Many believe species have an intrinsic right to exist, and biodiversity provides aesthetic beauty and recreational opportunities.
    - **Scientific Research:** Offers opportunities to study evolution, ecology, and potential new resources or biological processes.

_(b) What are the threats to tiger conservation in Bangladesh? (2 Marks)_

- Threats to tiger conservation in Bangladesh (primarily in the Sundarbans) include:
    - **Habitat Loss and Fragmentation:** Degradation of mangrove forests due to human encroachment, resource extraction, and climate change impacts (sea-level rise, salinity increase).
    - **Poaching:** Illegal hunting of tigers for their body parts (skin, bones) used in traditional medicine and black markets.
    - **Prey Depletion:** Reduction in the population of prey animals (like deer) due to poaching and habitat degradation, reducing the tigers' food source.
    - **Human-Tiger Conflict:** Tigers may stray into villages near the forest, leading to retaliatory killings by humans fearing for their safety or livestock.
    - **Climate Change:** Sea-level rise threatens to submerge significant portions of the Sundarbans habitat.

_(c) What is meant by Community Conserved Area (CCA)? (2 Marks)_

- A Community Conserved Area (CCA), also known as an ICCA (Indigenous Peoples' and Community Conserved Territories and Areas), refers to natural ecosystems (forests, wetlands, coastal areas, etc.) where indigenous peoples or local communities take initiatives to conserve biodiversity and associated cultural values voluntarily. Governance and management are primarily undertaken by the community itself, often based on traditional knowledge, customary laws, or locally agreed rules, rather than by state agencies alone. CCAs emphasize the role of local communities in effective and sustainable conservation.

_(d) What is meant by Renewable resource? (1.5 Marks)_

- A renewable resource is a natural resource that can be replenished naturally over time at a rate comparable to, or faster than, its rate of consumption by humans. Examples include solar energy, wind energy, hydropower (water), geothermal energy, biomass (if harvested sustainably), and timber (if forests are managed sustainably). Unlike non-renewable resources (like fossil fuels), they are not depleted permanently with use, making them crucial for long-term sustainability.
