    - _It is possible that the question intended to ask about "radiation" and its use in the medical field, such as radiotherapy._
    - Radiotherapy uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells.

**4. (c) What do you mean by the polarity and Curie point of a magnet? What is ferromagnetism? Describe how a ferromagnet can be converted into a paramagnet. (3)**
