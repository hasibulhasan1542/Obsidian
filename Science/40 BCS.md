### **Part A: General Science**
**Total Marks: 60**
**(Answer any eight questions)**

---

### **Question 1**

**(a) Write the general characteristics of acids and bases. What is an indicator? (1.5 + 0.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **General Characteristics of Acids:**
    *   They have a sour taste.
    *   They turn blue litmus paper red.
    *   They react with active metals to produce hydrogen gas.
    *   They react with bases to form salt and water (neutralization).
*   **General Characteristics of Bases:**
    *   They have a bitter taste and feel slippery.
    *   They turn red litmus paper blue.
    *   They react with acids to form salt and water.
*   **Indicator:** An indicator is a substance (usually a weak organic acid or base) that changes color in response to a change in chemical conditions, such as pH. It is used to visually determine the acidity or basicity of a solution.

---

**(b) Discuss the causes of acidity in the human body and the method of selecting the right food for its remedy. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Causes of Acidity:** Acidity (acid reflux or heartburn) in the human body is primarily caused by the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. This can be triggered by:
    *   Overeating or eating large meals.
    *   Lying down immediately after eating.
    *   Consumption of certain foods like spicy, fatty, or fried foods, citrus fruits, tomatoes, caffeine, and carbonated drinks.
    *   Lifestyle factors like obesity, smoking, and stress.
*   **Selecting the Right Food for Remedy:** To remedy acidity, one should select alkaline-forming or low-acid foods. This includes:
    *   **Vegetables:** Leafy greens, cucumbers, broccoli.
    *   **Non-citrus Fruits:** Bananas, melons, apples.
    *   **Lean Proteins:** Grilled chicken, fish.
    *   **Whole Grains:** Oatmeal, brown rice.
    *   Drinking plenty of water and avoiding trigger foods are crucial.

**(c) What is pH? If the concentration of H⁺ ions increases 10 times by adding acid to pure water, what will be the pH of the water? Why does aquatic life become unsuitable in a water body when industrial waste containing sulfuric acid is discharged into it? (1.5 + 3 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **pH:** pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration (`pH = -log[H⁺]`).
*   **pH Calculation:**
    *   Pure water has a neutral pH of 7. This means its [H⁺] is 10⁻⁷ M.
    *   If the [H⁺] concentration increases 10 times, the new concentration will be 10 x 10⁻⁷ M = 10⁻⁶ M.
    *   The new pH will be: `pH = -log(10⁻⁶) = 6`.
*   **Effect on Aquatic Life:** When industrial waste containing sulfuric acid is discharged into a water body, it drastically lowers the pH, making the water highly acidic. This severe change in pH is unsuitable for aquatic life because:
    *   It damages the gills and skin of fish.
    *   It disrupts the enzymes and metabolic processes essential for their survival.
    *   It can dissolve toxic heavy metals from sediments into the water, further poisoning the aquatic organisms.

### **Question 2**

**(a) What is fossil fuel? How is this fuel formed in nature? (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Fossil Fuel:** Fossil fuels are natural fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, formed in the Earth's crust from the fossilized, buried remains of dead plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.
*   **Formation:** Over millions of years, the remains of these organisms were buried under layers of sediment. The immense heat and pressure from these layers transformed the organic matter into carbon-rich substances. Plant remains primarily formed coal, while marine organisms formed oil and natural gas.

---

**(b) What is petroleum gas? Describe how petroleum gas and gasoline are obtained from crude oil by fractional distillation. (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Petroleum Gas:** A mixture of flammable hydrocarbon gases (like propane and butane) obtained during the refining of crude oil. It is often liquefied under pressure to form LPG.
*   **Fractional Distillation:** This process separates crude oil into different components (fractions) based on their different boiling points.
    1.  Crude oil is heated in a furnace to a high temperature, turning it into a hot mixture of liquid and vapor.
    2.  This mixture is pumped into the bottom of a tall fractionating column, which is hot at the bottom and cooler at the top.
    3.  The hot vapors rise up the column. As they rise, they cool and condense at different levels (on trays) according to their boiling points.
    *   Fractions with low boiling points, like **petroleum gas**, rise to the very top before condensing.
    *   Fractions with slightly higher boiling points, like **gasoline (petrol)**, condense on trays lower down.
    The different condensed liquids are then collected from their respective trays.

---

**(c) What are biomass and biogas? Briefly write the main components of biogas and its uses. (3 marks)**

    1.  Troposphere
    2.  Stratosphere
    3.  Mesosphere
    4.  Thermosphere
    5.  Exosphere
*   **Characteristics of Two Layers:**
    1.  **Troposphere:** It is the lowest layer, extending up to about 8-15 km. It contains about 75% of the atmosphere's mass and almost all of its water vapor. All weather phenomena occur in this layer.
    2.  **Stratosphere:** This layer lies above the troposphere and contains the **ozone layer**, which absorbs the majority of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

---

**(b) What is the role of O₂, CO₂, and N₂ in the atmosphere? Why does the sea level rise if the amount of CO₂ increases? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Role of Gases:**
    *   **Oxygen (O₂):** Essential for the respiration of most living organisms.
    *   **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** Used by plants for photosynthesis; also a major greenhouse gas that traps heat.
    *   **Nitrogen (N₂):** The most abundant gas, it is relatively inert but is a crucial component of proteins and nucleic acids for life.
*   **Reason for Sea Level Rise:** An increase in the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere enhances the greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and causing **global warming**. This rise in global temperature leads to two main effects that cause sea levels to rise:
    1.  **Melting of Ice:** Glaciers and polar ice caps melt at an accelerated rate, adding vast amounts of water to the oceans.
    2.  **Thermal Expansion:** As the ocean water warms, it expands in volume.

---

**(c) What is a tide? Why do high tides and low tides occur twice a day? (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Tide:** Tides are the regular rise and fall of the Earth's ocean water levels, caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun.
*   **Reason for Twice-Daily Tides:** The Moon's gravity pulls the ocean water on the side of the Earth nearest to it, creating a **high tide bulge**. Simultaneously, on the opposite side of the Earth, the centrifugal force created by the Earth's rotation causes another **high tide bulge**. The areas in between these two bulges experience **low tides**. As the Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, any given point on the coast passes through both of these high tide bulges and both low tide areas, thus experiencing two high tides and two low tides approximately each day.

---

**(c) What is meant by the polarity and Curie point of a magnet? What is ferromagnetism? Describe how a ferromagnet can be converted into a paramagnet. (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Polarity:** The polarity of a magnet refers to its two poles, the **north pole** and the **south pole**, where the magnetic force is strongest.
*   **Curie Point (or Curie Temperature):** The Curie point is the specific temperature above which a ferromagnetic material loses its permanent magnetic properties and becomes paramagnetic.
*   **Ferromagnetism:** Ferromagnetism is the property of certain materials (like iron) that allows them to be strongly attracted to a magnet and to be magnetized themselves.
*   **Conversion to Paramagnet:** A ferromagnetic material can be converted into a paramagnetic material simply by **heating it above its Curie point**. At this high temperature, the thermal energy becomes strong enough to overcome the alignment of the magnetic domains, causing them to become randomly oriented, thus losing their strong, permanent magnetism.

---

**(c) What is night blindness? What causes night blindness? Discuss in detail. What steps should be taken to remedy this disease? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Night Blindness (Nyctalopia):** A condition where a person finds it difficult or impossible to see in low light or at night.
*   **Cause:** The most common cause is a **deficiency of Vitamin A**. Vitamin A is essential for the production of **rhodopsin**, a light-sensitive pigment in the **rod cells** of the retina. Rod cells are responsible for vision in low-light conditions. Without sufficient Vitamin A, the body cannot produce enough rhodopsin, leading to an inability to see properly in the dark.
*   **Remedy:** The primary remedy is to ensure an adequate intake of Vitamin A. This can be done by:
    *   Consuming Vitamin A-rich foods like carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, liver, and dairy products.
    *   Taking Vitamin A supplements under medical supervision.

---

**(d) What are the components of a balanced diet? How does diet lead to weight gain and subsequently cause diabetes? (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Components of a Balanced Diet:**
    1.  Carbohydrates
    2.  Proteins
    3.  Fats
    4.  Vitamins
    5.  Minerals
    6.  Water
*   **How Diet Leads to Diabetes:** A diet high in processed foods, unhealthy fats, and refined sugars is very calorie-dense. Consuming more calories than the body uses for energy leads to **weight gain** and **obesity**, particularly an accumulation of visceral fat around the abdomen. This excess fat can cause the body's cells to become resistant to the effects of **insulin** (a condition called insulin resistance). Insulin resistance means the pancreas has to work harder to control blood sugar, and eventually, it may not be able to produce enough insulin, leading to the development of **Type 2 Diabetes**.

---

### **Question 7**

**(a) Name four waterborne diseases. What is the cause of Beriberi? Why is Vitamin D found in sunlight? - Explain. (1.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Four Waterborne Diseases:** Cholera, Typhoid, Dysentery, Hepatitis A.
*   **Cause of Beriberi:** Beriberi is caused by a deficiency of **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**.
*   **Vitamin D in Sunlight:** Vitamin D is not literally "found" in sunlight. Rather, sunlight (specifically, ultraviolet B or UVB radiation) acts as a catalyst. When UVB rays from the sun strike the skin, they trigger a chemical reaction that converts a type of cholesterol in the skin into **Vitamin D3**, which the body can then use.

---

**(b) What are blood cells? Why does blood look red? What is Hepatitis? What causes Hepatitis? Name two Hepatitis viruses transmitted through blood. (3 marks)**

**Answer:**

---

**(c) Why does the sun look red at sunrise and sunset? (3 marks)**

**Answer:**
The sun looks red at sunrise and sunset due to the **scattering of light** by the Earth's atmosphere. At these times, the sunlight has to travel through a much thicker layer of the atmosphere to reach our eyes compared to when the sun is overhead.
1.  According to Rayleigh's Law, shorter wavelength light (like blue and violet) is scattered much more effectively by the air molecules than longer wavelength light (like red and orange).
2.  When the sun is low on the horizon, most of the blue light is scattered away from our line of sight.
3.  This leaves the longer wavelength red and orange light to travel directly to our eyes, making the sun and the surrounding sky appear red.

### **Part C: Computer and Information Technology**
**Total Marks: 15**
**(Answer any six questions)**

---

### **Question 11**

**(a) Write the main difference between Analog and Digital signals. Explain the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a wave. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
*   **Difference between Analog and Digital Signals:**
    *   **Analog Signal:** A continuous wave that represents information in a continuous range of values. It is more susceptible to noise and degradation.
    *   **Digital Signal:** A discrete wave that represents information in a binary format (a series of 0s and 1s) at distinct intervals. It is more immune to noise.

*   **Relationship between Wavelength and Frequency:**
    Wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) of a wave are **inversely proportional**. This means that as the frequency of a wave increases, its wavelength decreases, and vice versa. The relationship is defined by the formula:
    `c = fλ`
    where:
    *   `c` is the constant speed of the wave (e.g., the speed of light for electromagnetic waves).
    *   `f` is the frequency.
    *   `λ` is the wavelength.

**(b) Describe Kirchhoff's Voltage Law with a diagram. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):** This law states that the algebraic sum of all the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop or mesh in a circuit is equal to zero. This law is based on the principle of conservation of energy.

**Diagram and Explanation:**
Consider a simple series circuit with a voltage source (V) and two resistors (R₁ and R₂).

```
      +-------[ R₁ ]-------+
      |                    |
      V (+)                |   (Current I flows in this direction)
      | (-)                |
      +-------[ R₂ ]-------+
```

1.  The battery provides a voltage rise (V).
2.  As current (I) flows through the resistors, it creates a voltage drop across each one (V₁ across R₁ and V₂ across R₂).
3.  According to KVL, for the closed loop, the sum of voltage rises must equal the sum of voltage drops.
    Therefore: `V = V₁ + V₂`
    Or, expressed as an algebraic sum around the loop: `V - V₁ - V₂ = 0`

It integrates thousands or millions of tiny electronic components like transistors, resistors, and capacitors into a compact package.
*   **Uses of Digital ICs:** Digital ICs are the fundamental building blocks of almost all modern electronic devices. Their uses include:
    *   **Computers and Smartphones:** In microprocessors (CPUs) and memory chips (RAM, ROM).
    *   **Logic Operations:** Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) used to perform digital logic.
    *   **Consumer Electronics:** In calculators, digital watches, cameras, and televisions.
    *   **Embedded Systems:** In microcontrollers that control devices like washing machines and cars.

**(d) Write the difference between AC and DC voltage. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**

| Feature | AC (Alternating Current) Voltage | DC (Direct Current) Voltage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction of Flow** | The polarity periodically reverses, causing the current to change direction. | The polarity is constant, and the current flows steadily in one direction. |
| **Waveform** | Typically a sine wave. | A straight, constant line. |
| **Source** | Generated by alternators (e.g., in power plants). | Produced by batteries, solar cells, and AC-to-DC power adapters. |
| **Transmission** | Can be easily stepped up or down with transformers, making it efficient for long-distance transmission. | Difficult and expensive to step up or down, making long-distance transmission less efficient. |

**(e) Briefly describe how Radar works. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
**RADAR** (which stands for **RA**dio **D**etection **A**nd **R**anging) works on the principle of transmitting radio waves and analyzing the echoes that return after hitting an object. The process is as follows:
1.  **Transmission:** The radar system's antenna transmits a short pulse of high-frequency radio waves in a specific direction.
2.  **Reflection (Echo):** These waves travel through the air until they strike an object (like an airplane or a ship), at which point they are reflected in various directions.
3.  **Reception:** A small portion of the reflected waves (the echo) travels back to the radar's antenna, which now acts as a receiver.
4.  **Analysis:** The system's computer analyzes the echo to determine:
    *   **Distance:** Calculated from the time it took for the echo to return.
    *   **Direction:** Determined by the direction the antenna was pointing when the echo was received.
    *   **Speed:** Calculated by measuring the change in the echo's frequency (the Doppler effect).

**(f) Briefly describe the working principle of an electrical transformer. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**
The working principle of an electrical transformer is **mutual electromagnetic induction**. A transformer consists of two separate coils of wire, a **primary coil** and a **secondary coil**, that are wound on a common laminated iron core.
1.  When an **alternating current (AC)** is passed through the primary coil, it creates a continuously changing magnetic field (or magnetic flux) in the iron core.
2.  This changing magnetic flux links with the secondary coil.
3.  According to Faraday's Law of Induction, this changing flux induces an alternating voltage in the secondary coil.
The voltage is "stepped up" if the secondary coil has more turns than the primary, and "stepped down" if it has fewer turns. Transformers only work with AC, as DC produces a constant magnetic field which cannot induce a voltage.

**(g) Mention the differences between radio waves and microwaves. (2.5 marks)**

**Answer:**

| Feature | Radio Waves | Microwaves |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency/Wavelength** | Lower frequency and longer wavelength. | Higher frequency and shorter wavelength. |
| **Bandwidth** | Offer lower bandwidth, suitable for carrying less information (e.g., sound). | Offer much higher bandwidth, allowing for faster data rates (e.g., for internet). |
| **Propagation** | Can travel long distances and can diffract around obstacles and pass through walls. | Travel in a straight line (line-of-sight) and are easily blocked by obstacles like buildings. |
| **Applications** | AM/FM radio broadcasting, television signals, long-range communication. | Satellite communication, Wi-Fi, radar, mobile phone networks, and microwave ovens. |

**Answer:**
A circuit breaker is an automatic electrical switch designed to protect a circuit from damage caused by an overcurrent. It works using two mechanisms:

1.  **Thermal Trip (for Overloads):** A **bimetallic strip** inside the breaker heats up and bends when a sustained, moderate overcurrent flows through it. This bending trips a mechanical latch, opening the circuit. This protects against overloaded circuits.
2.  **Magnetic Trip (for Short Circuits):** A very high and sudden surge of current (a short circuit) creates a strong magnetic field in an **electromagnet** (solenoid). This magnetic force instantly pulls a plunger that trips the latch, opening the circuit much faster than the thermal mechanism.

**Simplified Diagram Description:**
A diagram would show the input and output terminals connected through a pair of contacts. One contact is movable and held in place by a spring-loaded latch. Both the bimetallic strip and the electromagnet are positioned to release this latch when activated, causing the contacts to spring apart and break the circuit.
