### **Question 1(a)**

**Original:** (ক) আলোর প্রতিফলন কত প্রকার ও কী কী? ব্যাখ্যা করুন।
**Translation:** How many types of reflection of light are there and what are they? Explain.
**Marks:** 1.5

#### **Answer:**

The reflection of light is the phenomenon of light bouncing back after striking a surface. There are two main types of reflection:

1.  **Regular (or Specular) Reflection:**
    *   **Explanation:** This occurs when a parallel beam of light strikes a smooth, polished surface (like a mirror or still water). After reflection, the light rays remain parallel to each other. This type of reflection creates a clear, sharp image.
    *   **Condition:** The surface irregularities must be smaller than the wavelength of the incident light. The laws of reflection (angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection) are obeyed by each individual ray.

2.  **Irregular (or Diffuse) Reflection:**
    *   **Explanation:** This occurs when a parallel beam of light strikes a rough or uneven surface (like paper, wood, or a wall). After reflection, the light rays are scattered in many different directions. No clear image is formed, but the surface becomes visible from multiple angles.
    *   **Condition:** The surface has irregularities that are large compared to the wavelength of light. Although the laws of reflection are still obeyed at the microscopic level for each individual ray, the varied orientation of the surface causes the overall reflected beam to be scattered.

### **Question 1(b)**

**Original:** (খ) LASER কী? এর বৈশিষ্ট্য ও ব্যবহার আলোচনা করুন।
**Translation:** What is LASER? Discuss its characteristics and uses.
**Marks:** 3

#### **Answer:**

**LASER** stands for **L**ight **A**mplification by **S**timulated **E**mission of **R**adiation. It is a device that generates an intense beam of coherent, monochromatic light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of photons.

**Characteristics of LASER Light:**
1.  **Monochromatic:** Laser light consists of a single wavelength or a very narrow range of wavelengths, meaning it is of a single, pure color.
2.  **Coherent:** The light waves in a laser beam are in phase with each other in both space and time. This means their crests and troughs align, which allows the beam to be highly focused and powerful.
3.  **Directional:** Laser light is emitted as a highly concentrated, narrow beam that spreads out very little over long distances (low divergence). This allows it to travel far while maintaining its intensity.
4.  **High Intensity:** Because the energy is concentrated in a very small area and the beam is directional, laser light is extremely bright and intense, far exceeding the intensity of conventional light sources.

**Uses of LASER:**
*   **Medicine:** Used in surgery (e.g., LASIK eye surgery, cutting tissue), dermatology (removing tattoos, hair), and medical diagnostics.
*   **Industry:** Used for precise cutting, welding, drilling, and engraving of materials like metals and diamonds.
*   **Telecommunications:** Used in fiber-optic communication systems to transmit data over long distances.
*   **Information Technology:** Used in CD/DVD/Blu-ray players to read and write data, and in laser printers.
*   **Scientific Research:** Used in spectroscopy, interferometry, and for studying atomic and molecular structures.
*   **Military:** Used in rangefinders, target designation, and missile guidance systems.

**Translation:** Write the uses of different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
**Marks:** 3

#### **Answer:**

The electromagnetic spectrum consists of various types of waves, each with distinct uses based on its wavelength and energy.

*   **Radio Waves:** Used in broadcasting for AM/FM radio, television signals, mobile phone communication, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and radar systems for navigation and weather forecasting.
*   **Microwaves:** Used in microwave ovens for cooking, telecommunications (satellite and terrestrial), and in radar systems for more precise detection.
*   **Infrared (IR) Radiation:** Used in thermal imaging cameras (thermography), night vision devices, remote controls for electronic appliances, and for short-range data transfer (e.g., IrDA). It is also the primary mechanism of heat transfer.
*   **Visible Light:** The only part of the spectrum visible to the human eye, essential for vision and photography. It is also used in optical fibers for communication and in various lighting applications.
*   **Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation:** Used for sterilization of medical equipment and disinfecting water (germicidal lamps), in "black lights" for detecting counterfeit currency, and by the body to produce Vitamin D. Overexposure is harmful.
*   **X-rays:** Used in medical imaging to view bones and detect fractures (radiography) and in airport security scanners. Also used in crystallography to study the structure of materials.
*   **Gamma Rays:** The highest energy waves, used in medicine for radiation therapy (radiotherapy) to destroy cancer cells and for sterilizing medical equipment. Also used in industrial inspection to detect flaws in metal castings.

### **Question 2(a)**

**Original:** (ক) টর্ক কাকে বলে? এর ব্যবহার লিখুন।
**Translation:** What is torque? Write its application.
**Marks:** 2

#### **Answer:**

**Torque**, also known as the moment of force, is a measure of the rotational force that can cause an object to rotate about an axis. It is the rotational equivalent of linear force. Torque is calculated as the product of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied.
Mathematically, `τ = r × F`, where τ is torque, r is the position vector, and F is the force.

**Applications of Torque:**
*   **Using a Wrench:** Applying force to the handle of a wrench creates torque to tighten or loosen a nut or bolt. A longer handle allows the same torque to be produced with less force.
*   **Opening a Door:** Pushing a door far from its hinges (the axis of rotation) requires less force to produce the necessary torque to open it.
*   **Riding a Bicycle:** The force applied to the pedals creates torque on the crank, which causes the wheels to rotate.
*   **Internal Combustion Engines:** The engine produces torque on the crankshaft, which is then transmitted to the wheels of a vehicle to make it move.

### **Question 2(c)**

**Original:** (গ) শব্দ তরঙ্গের বৈশিষ্ট্য লিখুন।
**Translation:** Write the characteristics of sound waves.
**Marks:** 1.5

#### **Answer:**

Sound waves are longitudinal, mechanical waves that require a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel. Their main characteristics are:

1.  **Pitch (Frequency):** Pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower." It is determined by the frequency of the sound wave (measured in Hertz, Hz). High frequency corresponds to a high pitch, and low frequency corresponds to a low pitch.
2.  **Loudness (Amplitude):** Loudness is the perceived intensity of a sound. It is determined by the amplitude of the sound wave. A larger amplitude corresponds to a louder sound, and a smaller amplitude corresponds to a quieter sound. Loudness is measured in decibels (dB).
3.  **Timbre (Quality or Tone):** Timbre is the characteristic that distinguishes different types of sound production, such as voices and musical instruments. It allows us to differentiate between two sounds of the same pitch and loudness (e.g., a flute and a violin playing the same note). It is determined by the harmonic content (overtones) of a sound wave.

### **Question 3(c)**

**Original:** (গ) বাফার দ্রবণ কী? CH3COOH এবং CH3COONa এর সমমোলার দ্রবণ কীভাবে বাফার হিসাবে কাজ করে?
**Translation:** What is a buffer solution? How does an equimolar solution of CH₃COOH and CH₃COONa act as a buffer?
**Marks:** 2

#### **Answer:**

A **buffer solution** is an aqueous solution that can resist changes in pH upon the addition of small amounts of an acid or a base. It consists of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

An equimolar solution of acetic acid (CH₃COOH, a weak acid) and sodium acetate (CH₃COONa, which provides its conjugate base, the acetate ion CH₃COO⁻) acts as an acidic buffer. Its mechanism is as follows:
The solution contains a high concentration of both CH₃COOH molecules and CH₃COO⁻ ions.

*   **When a small amount of acid (H⁺) is added:** The conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) reacts with the added H⁺ ions and neutralizes them, forming the weak acid CH₃COOH. The equilibrium shifts to prevent a significant drop in pH.
    `CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H⁺ (aq) → CH₃COOH (aq)`
*   **When a small amount of base (OH⁻) is added:** The weak acid (CH₃COOH) reacts with the added OH⁻ ions and neutralizes them, forming water and acetate ions. This prevents a significant rise in pH.
    `CH₃COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq) → CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₂O (l)`

In both cases, the added strong acid or base is converted into a weak acid or base, thus minimizing the change in the overall pH of the solution.

*   **When a small amount of acid (H⁺) is added:** The conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) reacts with the added H⁺ ions and neutralizes them, forming the weak acid CH₃COOH. The equilibrium shifts to prevent a significant drop in pH.
    `CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H⁺ (aq) → CH₃COOH (aq)`
*   **When a small amount of base (OH⁻) is added:** The weak acid (CH₃COOH) reacts with the added OH⁻ ions and neutralizes them, forming water and acetate ions. This prevents a significant rise in pH.
    `CH₃COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq) → CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₂O (l)`

In both cases, the added strong acid or base is converted into a weak acid or base, thus minimizing the change in the overall pH of the solution.

### **Question 5(a)**

**Original:** (ক) গ্লোবাল ওয়ার্মিং এর কারণ ও প্রভাব আলোচনা করুন।  
**Translation:** Discuss the causes and effects of global warming.  
**Marks:** 3

#### **Answer:**

Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the pre-industrial period due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere.

**Causes of Global Warming:**  
The primary cause is the enhanced **greenhouse effect**.

1. **Burning of Fossil Fuels:** The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂), the main greenhouse gas.
    
2. **Deforestation:** Trees absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere. Cutting down forests reduces this capacity, leading to higher concentrations of CO₂.
    
3. **Industrial Processes:** Many industrial activities release other potent greenhouse gases like methane (CH₄) from agriculture and landfills, and nitrous oxide (N₂O) from fertilizers.
    
4. **Agriculture:** Livestock farming, particularly cattle, is a major source of methane emissions. Rice paddies also produce methane.
    

**Effects of Global Warming:**

1. **Rising Temperatures:** Average global temperatures are increasing, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves.
    
2. **Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels:** Glaciers and polar ice caps are melting at an accelerated rate, causing sea levels to rise. This threatens coastal cities and low-lying islands with flooding and erosion.
    
3. **Extreme Weather Events:** Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires.
    
4. **Disruption of Ecosystems:** Changes in climate patterns disrupt ecosystems, leading to loss of biodiversity as species struggle to adapt. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable (coral bleaching).
    
5. **Impact on Agriculture:** Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can negatively affect crop yields, threatening food security.

**Marks:** 2.5

#### **Answer:**

**Importance of the Ozone Layer:**  
The ozone layer is a region of Earth's stratosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone (O₃). Its primary importance is that it acts as a protective shield, absorbing the majority (about 97-99%) of the Sun's harmful **ultraviolet (UV) radiation**. By blocking this high-energy radiation, the ozone layer protects life on Earth from its damaging effects, which include:

- Increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts in humans.
    
- Damage to the immune system.
    
- Harm to marine life and ecosystems, especially phytoplankton.
    
- Reduced crop yields in agriculture.
    

**How to Protect It:**  
The main threat to the ozone layer comes from ozone-depleting substances (ODS), particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons. We can protect it by:

1. **Adhering to International Agreements:** The most critical step has been the **Montreal Protocol**, an international treaty designed to phase out the production and consumption of ODS. Continued compliance is essential.
    
2. **Using Alternatives to ODS:** Using hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and other safer alternatives in refrigerators, air conditioners, and aerosol sprays.
    
3. **Proper Disposal of Old Appliances:** Ensuring that old refrigerators and air conditioners containing CFCs are disposed of responsibly so that the chemicals are not released into the atmosphere.
    
4. **Reducing Personal Consumption:** Minimizing the use of products that contain or were manufactured with ODS.

**Translation:** What is a chromosome? How are chromosomes classified based on the position of the centromere?  
**Marks:** 2.5

#### **Answer:**

A **chromosome** is a thread-like structure of nucleic acids and protein found in the nucleus of most living cells. It carries genetic information in the form of genes and is responsible for heredity. Chromosomes become visible during cell division.

Based on the position of the centromere (the primary constriction point that divides the chromosome into two arms), chromosomes are classified into four main types:

1. **Metacentric:** The centromere is located in the middle, dividing the chromosome into two arms of roughly equal length. It appears V-shaped during anaphase.
    
2. **Submetacentric:** The centromere is located slightly off-center, resulting in one arm being shorter (p arm) than the other (q arm). It appears L-shaped during anaphase.
    
3. **Acrocentric:** The centromere is located very near one end, resulting in one very short arm and one very long arm. It appears J-shaped during anaphase.
    
4. **Telocentric:** The centromere is located at the terminal end of the chromosome, so there is effectively only one arm. It appears I-shaped during anaphase. (Telocentric chromosomes are not found in humans).

### **Question 7(a)**

**Original:** (ক) পলিমারকরণ কী? মনোমার থেকে কীভাবে পলিমার তৈরি করা হয় লিখুন।  
**Translation:** What is polymerization? Write how a polymer is made from monomers.  
**Marks:** 2.5

#### **Answer:**

**Polymerization** is a chemical process in which relatively small molecules, called **monomers**, combine chemically to produce a very large chain-like or network molecule, called a **polymer**.

A polymer is made from monomers through two primary methods:

1. **Addition Polymerization:**
    
    - **Process:** Monomers (typically containing a double or triple bond) are added to one another in succession to form a long chain without the loss of any atoms or molecules. The process involves three steps: initiation (an initiator creates a reactive site), propagation (the chain grows by adding monomers), and termination (the chain growth is stopped).
        
    - **Example:** The polymerization of ethylene (monomer) to form polyethylene (polymer). n(CH₂=CH₂) → -(CH₂-CH₂)-n
        
2. **Condensation Polymerization:**
    
    - **Process:** Monomers with two or more reactive functional groups react to form a polymer. In this process, a small molecule, such as water (H₂O), ammonia (NH₃), or hydrochloric acid (HCl), is eliminated or "condensed out" for each bond formed.
        
    - **Example:** The formation of Nylon 6,6 from the reaction of adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine, with the elimination of water molecules.

### **Question 7(c)**

**Original:** (গ) পলিথিন কী? পলিথিন ও প্লাস্টিক কীভাবে কৃষিজমিকে দূষিত করে-আলোচনা করুন।  
**Translation:** What is polythene? Discuss how polythene and plastic pollute agricultural land.  
**Marks:** 2.5

#### **Answer:**

**Polythene** (or polyethylene) is a thermoplastic polymer made from the polymerization of ethylene monomers. It is one of the most widely produced and used plastics in the world, known for its flexibility, durability, and resistance to chemicals.

**Pollution of Agricultural Land by Polythene and Plastic:**  
The improper disposal of polythene bags and other plastic waste leads to severe pollution of agricultural land in several ways:

1. **Soil Contamination and Degradation:** Plastics are **non-biodegradable**, meaning they do not break down naturally. They persist in the soil for hundreds of years, breaking down into smaller fragments called microplastics and nanoplastics. These fragments contaminate the soil, alter its physical structure, and reduce its fertility.
    
2. **Impeding Water and Air Flow:** Layers of plastic waste on or in the soil form an impermeable barrier. This prevents rainwater from seeping into the ground, reducing soil moisture and groundwater recharge. It also restricts the flow of air, which is essential for the roots of plants and soil microorganisms.
    
3. **Harming Soil Organisms:** Plastic fragments can be ingested by essential soil organisms like earthworms, harming or killing them. This disrupts the soil ecosystem and reduces its natural fertility.
    
4. **Obstructing Root Growth:** Plastic sheets and bags physically obstruct the growth of plant roots, stunting crop development and reducing yields.
    
5. **Leaching of Toxic Chemicals:** Many plastics contain additives like plasticizers and stabilizers. Over time, these toxic chemicals can leach out into the soil and water, contaminating crops and entering the food chain.
