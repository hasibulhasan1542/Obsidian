Of course. Here are the detailed, essay-style answers for questions 1 and 2 from the "Bangladesh Affairs" examination paper, as requested.

***

### **1. (a) Give a brief description of the Rarh region of ancient Bengal.**

The **Rarh region** (*রাঢ় জনপদ*) was one of the most prominent and historically significant politico-geographical units (*janapadas*) of ancient Bengal. Geographically, it was located in the western part of ancient Bengal, an area largely corresponding to the modern-day state of West Bengal in India. The region was broadly demarcated by the Bhagirathi-Hooghly river to its east and the Chota Nagpur Plateau to its west.

**Brief Description:**

1.  **Geographical Characteristics:** The Rarh region was characterized by its relatively high, undulating, and lateritic (reddish) soil, making it distinct from the marshy, alluvial deltaic plains of eastern and southern Bengal. This geography made the region less prone to flooding and suitable for early settlement.
2.  **Historical and Political Significance:** Ancient texts and inscriptions refer to the Rarh region, often dividing it into two parts: **Uttara-Rarh** (Northern Rarh) and **Dakkhina-Rarh** (Southern Rarh). It was a politically dynamic area that was home to powerful local kingdoms and was often contested by major imperial powers like the Guptas, the Palas, and the Senas. It was known for its martial traditions and was a key administrative and military stronghold for various dynasties.
3.  **Cultural and Religious Hub:** The region was also an important center of cultural and religious development. It was a strong center for Jainism in ancient times and later became a significant hub for Shaivism and Shaktism within the Hindu tradition. The distinct culture and dialect of this region contributed significantly to the broader tapestry of Bengali culture.

In essence, the Rarh region was a distinct geographical and cultural zone that played a vital role in shaping the political and cultural history of ancient Bengal.

### **1. (b) What is the Permanent Settlement?**

The **Permanent Settlement** (*চিরস্থায়ী বন্দোবস্ত*) was a grand and transformative land revenue system introduced in 1793 by the British East India Company under the administration of Governor-General Lord Cornwallis. It was primarily implemented in the Bengal Presidency, which included Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.

The core feature of the Permanent Settlement was the "permanent" fixing of the land revenue that the government would demand from the landholders. Its key characteristics were:

1.  **Creation of a Landlord Class:** The system recognized the existing *zamindars* (revenue collectors) not just as tax collectors, but as the absolute proprietors of the land. This effectively created a new class of hereditary landlords, similar to the landed aristocracy in Britain.
2.  **Fixed Revenue:** The amount of land revenue that each zamindar had to pay to the Company's government was fixed in perpetuity. This amount was set at a very high rate, calculated as ten-elevenths of the rent the zamindar was expected to collect from the peasants, with the zamindar keeping the remaining one-eleventh.
3.  **The "Sunset Law":** A stringent rule was attached, which stated that if a zamindar failed to pay the fixed revenue by sunset on the specified date, his entire estate (*zamindari*) would be auctioned off by the government.

While the Company's objective was to ensure a stable and guaranteed source of revenue and to create a loyal class of landlords, the Permanent Settlement had devastating long-term consequences. It left the actual cultivators, the peasants, entirely at the mercy of the zamindars, who could increase rents arbitrarily. It led to widespread peasant indebtedness, land alienation, and agrarian distress, fundamentally altering the rural social structure of Bengal for the next 150 years.

### **1. (c) What are the Six Points of the Awami League?**

The **Six-Point Program** (*ছয় দফা*) was a historic and revolutionary political charter put forward by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the Awami League, in 1966. It was presented as a constitutional roadmap for ending the systemic political, economic, and military exploitation of East Pakistan by the dominant West Pakistani establishment. The Six Points were effectively a charter for radical provincial autonomy and are widely regarded as the **"Magna Carta"** or charter of freedom for the Bengali people.

The Six Points were:

1.  **Federal Parliamentary System:** The establishment of a federal system of government for Pakistan with a parliamentary form, where the legislature would be directly elected by the people on the basis of universal adult franchise.
2.  **Provincial Autonomy:** The federal government would be responsible for only two subjects: **Defense** and **Foreign Affairs**. All other residual subjects would be vested in the hands of the federating provinces (i.e., East Pakistan).
3.  **Separate Currencies or Monetary System:** The introduction of two separate but freely convertible currencies for the two wings of Pakistan; OR, if one currency was maintained, the establishment of a separate banking reserve system and fiscal policy for East Pakistan to prevent the flight of capital from the East to the West.
4.  **Fiscal Autonomy:** The power of taxation and revenue collection would be vested in the hands of the federating units. The federal government would be provided with its share of state taxes to meet its expenditures.
5.  **Separate Foreign Trade Accounts:** The two wings would have separate accounts for their foreign exchange earnings. The foreign exchange earned by East Pakistan would be under the control of East Pakistan.
6.  **Provincial Paramilitary Force:** East Pakistan would have the authority to maintain its own paramilitary or militia force for its self-defense.

### **1. (d) What is the main significance of the Awami League's victory in 1970?**

The main significance of the Awami League's victory in the 1970 general election of Pakistan was that it was a **clear, democratic, and overwhelming referendum on the Six-Point Program and a legitimate mandate for Bengali self-rule**. The victory transformed the demand for autonomy from a political aspiration into a constitutional right, ultimately making the independence of Bangladesh inevitable.

The significance can be broken down into three key points:

1.  **Undisputed Mandate for Autonomy:** The Awami League contested the election on a single-issue platform: the Six Points. By winning a landslide victory—securing 167 out of 169 seats in East Pakistan and an absolute majority in the all-Pakistan National Assembly—the people of East Bengal gave Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman an unassailable and democratically legitimate mandate to frame a new constitution based on the Six-Point Program.
2.  **Establishment of Bangabandhu as the Sole National Leader:** The victory established Bangabandhu not just as the leader of the Bengalis, but as the leader of the majority party in Pakistan and the Prime Minister-elect. It gave him the sole authority to speak and negotiate on behalf of the entire Bengali nation.
3.  **Legitimization of the Struggle for Independence:** The most profound significance lay in the reaction to the victory. The refusal of the Pakistani military junta and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's PPP to honor the election results and transfer power to the Awami League exposed their complete contempt for democracy. This intransigence closed all avenues for a peaceful political solution, stripped the Pakistani regime of its moral and legal authority to govern East Bengal, and thus provided the ultimate justification for the subsequent Non-Cooperation Movement and the final armed struggle for an independent Bangladesh.

***

### **2. (a) Briefly explain the geographical location of Bangladesh in South Asia.**

Bangladesh occupies a uniquely strategic and pivotal geographical location in South Asia. It is situated at the northeastern apex of the Indian subcontinent, forming a crucial land bridge between the two dynamic regions of **South Asia** and **Southeast Asia**.

Its geographical location can be briefly explained as follows:

*   **Regional Position:** It is bordered by India to the west, north, and east, and by Myanmar to the southeast. To the south, it has a long coastline along the Bay of Bengal, which opens into the vast Indian Ocean.
*   **A Riverine Delta:** Geographically, Bangladesh is the world's largest and most fertile river delta, formed by the confluence of three mighty Himalayan rivers: the Ganges (known as the Padma in Bangladesh), the Brahmaputra (Jamuna), and the Meghna. This riverine character defines its landscape, economy, and culture.
*   **Geostrategic Importance:** Its location makes it a natural gateway for trade and transport for its landlocked neighbors, Nepal and Bhutan, as well as for India's landlocked northeastern states. Its coastline on the Bay of Bengal places it at the center of growing maritime activity in the Indian Ocean. This position allows Bangladesh to play a critical role in regional and sub-regional connectivity initiatives like BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) and the BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal) initiative.

In essence, Bangladesh's geographical location at the crossroads of South and Southeast Asia, combined with its maritime access to the Bay of Bengal, gives it a distinct strategic advantage and makes it a key player in the region's geopolitics and economy.

### **2. (b) What is the economic importance of the Bay of Bengal?**

The Bay of Bengal is an asset of immense and growing economic importance for Bangladesh, serving as the country's gateway to the world and a vast repository of natural resources. Its economic significance is multifaceted:

1.  **Maritime Trade and Commerce:** The Bay of Bengal is the lifeline of Bangladesh's external trade. The nation's two major seaports, **Chattogram (Chittagong) and Mongla**, are located on its coastline. Over 90% of the country's international trade by volume, including the import of raw materials and capital machinery and the export of its vital ready-made garments, is conducted through these ports.
2.  **Living Marine Resources (Fisheries):** The Bay is a rich fishing ground, providing a significant portion of the nation's protein supply and supporting the livelihoods of millions of coastal fishermen and workers in the fish processing industry. The export of fish and shrimp from the Bay is a valuable source of foreign exchange earnings.
3.  **Non-Living Natural Resources (Energy and Minerals):** The continental shelf of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal holds potentially vast reserves of **natural gas**. The successful exploration and exploitation of these offshore gas blocks are considered crucial for meeting the country's future energy demands. The seabed also contains other valuable mineral resources.
4.  **The "Blue Economy" Potential:** The concept of the "Blue Economy" refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth. For Bangladesh, this has enormous potential. Beyond fisheries and energy, it includes developing sectors like marine aquaculture, maritime tourism (e.g., cruises, coastal resorts), shipbuilding, and harnessing marine renewable energy (e.g., from wind or tides).
5.  **Strategic Connectivity:** The Bay of Bengal is a vital artery of global maritime traffic. Bangladesh's ports can serve as regional transshipment hubs, providing sea access for its landlocked neighbors and for the northeastern states of India, generating significant revenue from transit and port services.

Following the successful and peaceful resolution of its maritime boundary disputes with Myanmar and India, Bangladesh now has sovereign rights over a vast sea area, unlocking immense potential to harness the Bay of Bengal as a key driver of its future economic prosperity.

### **2. (c) Give a brief description of the forest resources of Bangladesh.**

The forest resources of Bangladesh, while covering a relatively small percentage of the country's total land area (around 17%), are ecologically diverse and economically important. They are primarily categorized into three main types based on their geographical location and characteristics.

1.  **Hill Forests:** These forests are located in the hilly regions of the southeast (Chittagong Hill Tracts: Rangamati, Khagrachhari, Bandarban) and the northeast (Sylhet). This is the largest category of forest in Bangladesh. These are tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, characterized by tall trees and a multi-layered canopy. Important tree species include Garjan, Teak (often planted), Jarul, and various species of bamboo. These forests are a crucial source of timber, bamboo, and other forest products, and are vital for protecting the hilly terrain from soil erosion.
2.  **Mangrove Forests (The Sundarbans):** Located in the southwestern coastal region, the Sundarbans is the **world's largest single tract of mangrove forest** and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This forest is unique because it is dominated by salt-tolerant tree species, most notably the **Sundari** tree, from which the forest gets its name. The Sundarbans play an irreplaceable ecological role, acting as a natural barrier that protects the coastal population from cyclones and storm surges. It is also a vital habitat for a rich diversity of wildlife, including the Royal Bengal Tiger, and it provides a livelihood for millions through the collection of honey, fish, and Golpata (Nipa palm leaves).
3.  **Plain Land Forests (Sal Forests):** These are tropical moist deciduous forests located on the slightly elevated plain lands, primarily in the central region (the Madhupur Tract near Dhaka and Gazipur) and the northwestern region (as part of the Barind Tract). The dominant tree species in these forests is the **Sal** (*Shorea robusta*). These forests have been heavily degraded and encroached upon over the years due to population pressure, but they remain an important source of fuelwood and house-building materials for local communities.

In addition to these natural forests, the government has also undertaken extensive social forestry and coastal afforestation programs to increase the country's tree cover.

### **2. (d) Briefly discuss the environmental impact of the Teesta water crisis.**

The Teesta water crisis, caused by a drastic reduction in the river's downstream flow into Bangladesh during the dry season (December to March) due to large-scale water diversion upstream in India, has had a severe and multifaceted environmental impact on northern Bangladesh.

The key environmental impacts are:

1.  **Desertification and Land Degradation:** The lack of water flow leads to the drying up of the Teesta riverbed and its distributaries. This causes a significant drop in the groundwater table in the entire Teesta basin region of Bangladesh. The lack of surface water for irrigation and the depletion of groundwater are turning vast tracts of once-fertile agricultural land barren, leading to a process of **desertification**. The soil loses its moisture and organic content, degrading its quality.
2.  **Loss of Biodiversity:** The Teesta river system hosts a rich aquatic ecosystem. The severe reduction in water flow has led to the destruction of fish habitats and breeding grounds, causing a catastrophic decline in the region's fish population. Many indigenous fish species have disappeared. This has also affected the bird and other wildlife populations that depended on the riverine ecosystem.
3.  **Impact on Agriculture and Cropping Patterns:** The crisis has forced a change in traditional cropping patterns. Farmers who once cultivated water-intensive crops like Boro rice during the dry season are now unable to do so. This has disrupted the agricultural economy and threatened the food security and livelihoods of millions of farmers.
4.  **Disruption of the River's Morphology:** The drastic reduction in flow hinders the river's natural ability to carry silt. This leads to excessive siltation in the riverbed within Bangladesh, which in turn reduces the river's water-carrying capacity during the monsoon season, making the region more vulnerable to severe floods.

In essence, the Teesta water crisis is not just a water-sharing dispute; it is an ecological disaster in the making, causing irreversible damage to the environment, biodiversity, and agricultural landscape of northern Bangladesh.

Of course. Here are the detailed, essay-style answers for questions 3, 4, and 5 from the "Bangladesh Affairs" examination paper, as requested.

***

### **3. (a) Provide a description of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Bangladesh for the last five consecutive years.**

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. It serves as the primary indicator of a country's economic health and performance. Over the last five years (prior to the period this question was likely set), Bangladesh's economy demonstrated remarkable resilience and consistent high growth, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.

A description of the GDP growth for five consecutive fiscal years (FY) would be as follows:

*   **FY 2015-16:** The GDP growth rate was **7.11%**. This was a significant achievement, as it marked the first time the country's growth surpassed the 7% mark, breaking out of the "6% growth trap" it had been in for several years.
*   **FY 2016-17:** The economy continued its strong momentum, with the GDP growth rate accelerating further to **7.28%**. This was driven by strong performance in the industrial sector, particularly ready-made garments, and robust domestic consumption.
*   **FY 2017-18:** Bangladesh's economy showed even more impressive growth, with the GDP expanding by **7.86%**. This high growth was supported by record agricultural production, sustained export growth, and a significant increase in public investment in infrastructure projects.
*   **FY 2018-19:** The growth trajectory reached a historic peak in this fiscal year, with the GDP growing by a record **8.15%**. This was one of the highest growth rates in the world, solidifying Bangladesh's status as a development success story. Strong domestic demand and continued growth in the industrial and service sectors were the key drivers.
*   **FY 2019-20:** This year was impacted by the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in its final quarter. While the initial growth target was over 8%, the pandemic-induced lockdowns and global supply chain disruptions led to a slowdown. Despite this global shock, Bangladesh's economy showed remarkable resilience, and the final GDP growth was recorded at **3.45%** (as per final government data). This positive growth was a notable achievement at a time when most economies in the world were experiencing severe contractions.

This five-year period showcases a consistent and robust upward trend in Bangladesh's economic performance, demonstrating strong macroeconomic fundamentals even in the face of global adversities.

### **3. (b) What is the contribution of the remittance sector to the economic development of Bangladesh?**

The remittance sector is a vital pillar of the Bangladeshi economy and makes a profound and multifaceted contribution to its economic development. Remittances, the money sent home by millions of Bangladeshi expatriates working abroad, act as a crucial lifeline for the economy in several ways.

1.  **Strengthening Foreign Exchange Reserves and Balance of Payments:** Remittances are the second-largest source of foreign currency earnings for Bangladesh after RMG exports. This steady inflow of foreign exchange plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of the country's foreign exchange reserves. Strong reserves are essential for financing imports (such as capital machinery, industrial raw materials, and fuel), servicing foreign debt, and maintaining the stability of the national currency, the Taka. A healthy remittance flow provides a vital cushion for the country's balance of payments.
2.  **Driving Consumption and Economic Growth:** A significant portion of remittance income is used by the recipient families for household consumption. This boosts domestic demand for goods and services, which in turn stimulates local production, creates jobs, and contributes directly to GDP growth.
3.  **Poverty Alleviation and Improved Living Standards:** Remittances have a direct and powerful impact on poverty reduction. For millions of poor and lower-middle-class families, remittances are the primary source of income. This money allows them to meet their basic needs, invest in better nutrition, healthcare, and housing, and significantly improve their standard of living. It acts as a form of social safety net, reducing their vulnerability to economic shocks.
4.  **Increasing National Savings and Investment:** Beyond consumption, a portion of remittance income is channeled into savings and investment. At the micro-level, families use this money to buy land, start small businesses, or invest in their children's education. At the macro-level, these funds increase national savings and contribute to capital formation, which is essential for long-term investment and economic development.

In summary, the remittance sector is a key engine of Bangladesh's economy, providing macroeconomic stability, fueling domestic demand, alleviating poverty, and fostering investment.

### **3. (c) Point out five obstacles in the way of industrialization in Bangladesh.**

Despite making significant strides in industrialization, particularly in the ready-made garment sector, Bangladesh still faces several critical obstacles that hinder its path towards becoming a diversified and advanced industrial economy. Five of the most prominent obstacles are:

1.  **Infrastructure Deficit:** This is arguably the most significant bottleneck. A lack of adequate and quality infrastructure severely hampers industrial efficiency. This includes:
    *   **Energy and Power Shortages:** Despite progress, inconsistent and inadequate electricity supply remains a major problem for industries.
    *   **Transport and Logistics:** Chronic traffic congestion in major cities like Dhaka and Chattogram, and underdeveloped road, rail, and port infrastructure increase the cost and time of transporting raw materials and finished goods.
2.  **Lack of Economic Diversification:** The industrial sector is overwhelmingly dependent on a single product: ready-made garments (RMG). While the RMG sector has been the engine of growth, this over-reliance makes the economy highly vulnerable to external shocks, changes in global consumer demand, or the withdrawal of trade preferences. There has been insufficient progress in developing other high-potential sectors like pharmaceuticals, leather goods, shipbuilding, or high-tech industries.
3.  **Shortage of Skilled Manpower:** While Bangladesh has an abundant supply of low-cost labor, there is a critical shortage of skilled technical and managerial manpower. The education system and vocational training infrastructure are not yet adequately aligned with the needs of modern, technologically advanced industries. This forces industries to often hire foreign experts for high-skilled jobs, which increases operational costs.
4.  **Weaknesses in Governance and Business Environment:** Bureaucratic red tape, a complex regulatory environment, and corruption remain significant deterrents to both domestic and foreign investment. The challenges in enforcing contracts, acquiring land for industrial purposes, and obtaining necessary licenses and permits increase the cost of doing business and create an environment of uncertainty.
5.  **Limited Access to Finance, Especially for SMEs:** While large corporations can often secure financing, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), which form the backbone of a diversified industrial economy, face significant challenges in accessing affordable credit from the formal banking sector due to stringent collateral requirements and complex procedures. This stifles the growth of new and innovative enterprises.

### **3. (d) Give a brief idea of the progress of Bangladesh in the social development index.**

Bangladesh has achieved remarkable and internationally acclaimed progress in various social development indices, often outperforming countries with higher levels of per capita income. This success is a testament to the country's focused investment in human capital and social programs.

A brief idea of the progress can be given through key indicators:

1.  **Human Development Index (HDI):** This is a composite index published by the UNDP that measures life expectancy, education, and per capita income. Bangladesh has shown consistent and impressive progress in its HDI score and ranking. It has successfully moved from the "Low Human Development" category to the **"Medium Human Development"** category, reflecting significant improvements across all three dimensions.
2.  **Poverty Reduction:** Bangladesh has made spectacular progress in poverty alleviation. The national poverty rate has been more than halved over the past two decades. This has been achieved through a combination of sustained economic growth, microcredit programs, and extensive social safety nets.
3.  **Gender Equality:** This is an area where Bangladesh's progress has been particularly noteworthy. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report, Bangladesh has consistently been the **top-performing country in South Asia**. This is driven by its remarkable success in achieving gender parity in primary and secondary education, and its strong performance in political empowerment, with women having served as the head of government for extended periods.
4.  **Health Indicators:** There have been dramatic improvements in public health.
    *   **Life Expectancy:** The average life expectancy in Bangladesh has risen significantly, now surpassing that of neighboring giants like India and Pakistan.
    *   **Reduction in Mortality Rates:** The infant mortality rate and the under-5 mortality rate have been reduced dramatically, thanks to successful national immunization programs (EPI). The maternal mortality rate has also seen a very sharp decline.

This consistent progress across a range of social development indicators demonstrates a strong state commitment to inclusive development and has earned Bangladesh global recognition as a development model.

### **4. (a) What do you understand by environmental disaster in Bangladesh?**

In the context of Bangladesh, an "environmental disaster" refers to a catastrophic event, either naturally occurring or human-induced, that causes widespread damage to the environment, leading to significant loss of life, property, livelihoods, and ecological balance. Due to its unique geographical location, high population density, and low-lying topography, Bangladesh is exceptionally vulnerable to a range of environmental disasters.

What I understand by this term encompasses two main categories:

1.  **Natural Disasters Exacerbated by Climate Change:** These are the most common form of environmental disasters in Bangladesh. They include:
    *   **Tropical Cyclones and Storm Surges:** Devastating cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal, like Sidr and Aila, cause widespread destruction in the coastal belt.
    *   **Floods:** Both riverine floods caused by heavy monsoon rains and glacial melt in the Himalayas, and urban flash floods due to intense rainfall, regularly inundate large parts of the country.
    *   **Droughts:** Prolonged periods of low rainfall, particularly in the northern regions, lead to crop failure and water scarcity.
    *   **Riverbank Erosion:** The shifting courses of the country's mighty rivers devour thousands of homes and acres of farmland every year, creating environmental refugees.
2.  **Human-Induced Environmental Disasters:** These are disasters caused directly by human activities and mismanagement. They include:
    *   **Water and Soil Pollution:** The rampant and unregulated discharge of industrial effluents, agrochemicals, and untreated sewage into rivers and water bodies has turned many rivers biologically dead, poisoning the aquatic ecosystem and contaminating sources of drinking water.
    *   **Deforestation and Land Degradation:** The destruction of hill forests and plain land Sal forests has led to increased soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and disruption of local ecosystems.
    *   **Salinity Intrusion:** The combination of upstream water diversion and sea-level rise is causing saline water to penetrate further inland in the coastal areas, destroying agricultural land and contaminating freshwater sources.

In essence, an environmental disaster in Bangladesh is a severe disruption of the delicate balance between its people and its fragile natural environment, with devastating socio-economic consequences.

### **4. (b) In your opinion, what are the main causes of river pollution in Bangladesh?**

In my opinion, the main causes of the severe river pollution in Bangladesh are a combination of rapid and unregulated industrialization, unchecked urbanization, and a pervasive lack of enforcement of environmental laws.

The primary causes are:

1.  **Untreated Industrial Effluents:** This is the single largest cause. Thousands of industrial units, particularly in the textile dyeing, tannery, pharmaceutical, and fertilizer sectors, are concentrated along the banks of major rivers like the Buriganga, Shitalakshya, and Turag. The vast majority of these factories discharge their highly toxic and untreated liquid waste directly into the rivers. This waste contains heavy metals like chromium and lead, as well as poisonous dyes and chemicals that destroy all aquatic life and render the water unfit for human use.
2.  **Discharge of Untreated Urban Sewage:** The major cities of Bangladesh, including the capital Dhaka, lack adequate sewerage and wastewater treatment facilities. As a result, enormous quantities of untreated domestic sewage and solid waste from millions of households are dumped directly into the surrounding rivers every day.
3.  **Agrochemical Runoff:** The widespread use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides in modern agriculture is another major contributor. During the monsoon season, the runoff from agricultural fields carries these harmful chemicals into the rivers and water bodies, leading to water contamination and eutrophication (algal blooms that deplete oxygen in the water).
4.  **River Encroachment and Dumping of Solid Waste:** The illegal encroachment on riverbanks and floodplains for construction, and the direct dumping of municipal and industrial solid waste into the rivers, physically constricts the river channels and leaches pollutants into the water.
5.  **Lack of Enforcement and a Culture of Impunity:** Underpinning all these physical causes is a fundamental failure of governance. While environmental laws and regulations exist, their enforcement is extremely weak due to a lack of institutional capacity, corruption, and a lack of political will to take action against powerful industrial polluters. This creates a culture of impunity where polluting the rivers carries few consequences.

### **4. (c) Present a picture of waste management in Bangladesh.**

The picture of waste management in Bangladesh is one of stark contrasts and significant challenges, particularly in its rapidly growing urban areas. While there have been some nascent efforts towards modernization, the overall system remains largely rudimentary, inefficient, and overwhelmed by the sheer volume of waste being generated.

The picture can be presented as follows:

**Urban Waste Management:**
*   **Collection:** Waste collection is the primary focus of the city corporations and municipalities. However, collection services are often inadequate and do not cover all areas of a city. In many neighborhoods, waste is simply dumped in open, designated spots or on the roadside, from where it is collected by municipal trucks. Door-to-door collection is being introduced in some areas, often by community-based private initiatives.
*   **Segregation:** There is virtually **no system for waste segregation at the source** (i.e., separating organic, plastic, and other waste at the household level). All types of waste—household, commercial, medical, and even industrial—are often mixed together.
*   **Disposal:** The predominant method of waste disposal is **crude open dumping**. The collected waste is transported to designated open landfills on the outskirts of cities. These landfills are often unsanitary, unlined, and poorly managed. They generate foul odors, pollute the air, and leach toxic liquids (leachate) that contaminate the surrounding soil and groundwater.
*   **The Informal Sector:** A crucial, yet often overlooked, part of the waste management picture is the vast informal sector. Thousands of urban poor, including women and children (*tokais*), make a living by sorting through the waste at dumpsites and on the streets to recover recyclable materials like plastic, glass, and metal. They play a vital but hazardous role in recycling.
*   **Modernization Efforts:** There are some positive developments. Some city corporations are exploring waste-to-energy projects and composting plants to treat organic waste. Awareness campaigns about proper waste disposal are also being conducted.

**Rural Waste Management:**
In rural areas, there is no formal waste management system. Household waste is typically disposed of in backyard pits, used as compost, or simply thrown into nearby ponds or fields. Plastic waste is an emerging and serious problem in rural areas as well.

In conclusion, the picture of waste management in Bangladesh is one of a system under immense strain, characterized by inadequate collection, a near-total absence of segregation, and a heavy reliance on unsanitary open dumping. Modernization is urgently needed to address this growing environmental and public health crisis.

### **4. (d) In the future, what effect could sea-level rise have on the climate of Bangladesh?**

The rise in sea level, a direct consequence of global warming, is projected to have a catastrophic and cascading effect on the climate, environment, and socio-economy of low-lying, deltaic Bangladesh. The effects will be profound and multifaceted.

1.  **Permanent Coastal Inundation:** This is the most direct and devastating effect. A significant rise in sea level will lead to the permanent submergence of large swathes of Bangladesh's coastal zone. This will result in the irreversible loss of vast areas of agricultural land, the destruction of homes and critical infrastructure, and the displacement of millions of people, creating a massive wave of internal "climate refugees."
2.  **Increased Frequency and Intensity of Coastal Flooding:** Sea-level rise will provide a higher base for storm surges. This means that when tropical cyclones make landfall, the resulting storm surges will penetrate much further inland and cause more extensive and destructive flooding than they do today. Even normal high tides will cause more frequent "nuisance flooding" in coastal cities and villages.
3.  **Severe Salinity Intrusion:** As the sea level rises, saline water from the Bay of Bengal will push much further inland, both on the surface in rivers and in underground aquifers. This will have several devastating effects:
    *   It will render vast areas of agricultural land unproductive for most traditional crops.
    *   It will contaminate sources of fresh drinking water, leading to major public health crises.
    *   It will destroy freshwater aquatic ecosystems and severely damage the unique ecosystem of the Sundarbans mangrove forest, which cannot tolerate very high levels of salinity.
4.  **Exacerbation of Riverbank Erosion:** Sea-level rise can alter the dynamics of river flows, potentially slowing down the discharge of river water into the sea. This can lead to increased siltation within the river channels, which in turn can intensify riverbank erosion further upstream during the monsoon season.
5.  **Threats to Coastal Ecosystems:** The entire coastal ecosystem, including the delicate balance of the Sundarbans, coastal wetlands, and estuarine habitats, will be severely threatened. The loss of these ecosystems will have a cascading effect on the rich biodiversity they support and the livelihoods of the millions of people who depend on them.

In essence, future sea-level rise poses an existential threat to Bangladesh. It will not just be an "environmental" problem but will fundamentally reshape the country's geography, disrupt its climate, and trigger immense social and economic crises.

### **5. (a) Write down Article 12 of the Bangladesh Constitution regarding secularism.**

**Article 12: Secularism and Freedom of Religion**

Article 12 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, as it was originally framed in 1972, laid down the principles for the realization of secularism. (Note: This article was omitted by a constitutional amendment and later restored, but with reference to its original intent).

The article stated that the principle of secularism shall be realized by the elimination of:

**(a) communalism in all its forms;**
**(b) the granting by the State of political status in favour of any religion;**
**(c) the abuse of religion for political purposes;**
**(d) any discrimination against, or persecution of, persons practicing a particular religion.**

This article clearly and powerfully defined the secular character of the state. It was not anti-religion; rather, it was a commitment to creating a society where religion would be a private matter of individual faith, completely separated from the political affairs of the state. It aimed to build a tolerant and inclusive nation where citizens of all faiths could live in harmony and with equal rights, free from discrimination or the political manipulation of religious sentiment.

### **5. (b) What kind of reform would you propose in Article 70 of the Bangladesh Constitution?**

Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh, often referred to as the "anti-floor-crossing" provision, is one of the most debated articles of the constitution. It states that a Member of Parliament (MP) shall vacate his or her seat if they resign from or vote against the political party that nominated them in the election. While its intention is to ensure party discipline and political stability, it is widely criticized for stifling internal democracy within parties and curbing the freedom of speech of individual MPs.

The reform I would propose would be a **balanced and pragmatic amendment** that preserves the article's core objective of preventing instability while empowering MPs to exercise their conscience on matters of national importance.

**Proposed Reform:**

I would propose amending Article 70 to make a clear distinction between two types of votes in Parliament:

1.  **Confidence and Supply Motions:** The strict provisions of Article 70 should **only** apply to votes that are critical for the survival of the government. These would be:
    *   A **vote of no-confidence** against the government.
    *   A vote on the **national budget** or any other **money bill**.
    On these crucial votes, an MP would still be required to vote along the party line. Voting against the party on these specific matters would lead to the vacation of their seat. This would ensure that governments remain stable and cannot be toppled by the defection of a few MPs.

2.  **All Other Legislative and Policy Matters:** For all other legislative bills and policy debates that are not matters of confidence or supply, the restrictions of Article 70 should be **removed**. On these issues, MPs should be **free to speak and vote according to their own conscience, judgment, and the interests of their constituents**, without the fear of losing their seat.

**Justification for the Reform:**
This proposed reform would achieve a healthy balance. It would maintain the political stability that Article 70 was designed to provide by protecting the government on critical confidence votes. At the same time, it would dramatically enhance the role and effectiveness of Parliament. It would empower individual MPs to become true legislators, to scrutinize government proposals more critically, to contribute to more robust and meaningful debates, and to hold the executive more accountable on a day-to-day basis. This would strengthen internal party democracy and make Parliament a more vibrant and representative institution.

### **5. (c) Mention five aspects of the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh.**

The Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh, passed in 2011, was a landmark and extensive amendment that brought about significant changes to the country's foundational legal document. Five of its most important aspects are:

1.  **Restoration of the Four Fundamental Principles of State Policy:** The amendment fully restored the four original fundamental principles of the 1972 Constitution: **Nationalism, Socialism, Democracy, and Secularism**. It reinstated Article 12 (Secularism and Freedom of Religion) and re-affirmed the secular and progressive character of the state as envisioned during its inception.
2.  **Abolition of the Caretaker Government System:** This was arguably the most controversial aspect of the amendment. It abolished the system of a non-party caretaker government (which had been introduced by the 13th Amendment) to oversee national elections. The amendment reinstated the system of holding general elections under the incumbent, party-led government.
3.  **Recognition of Bangabandhu as the Father of the Nation:** The amendment gave constitutional recognition to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation. It also incorporated his historic 7th March Speech and the Declaration of Independence into the Constitution.
4.  **Inclusion of Provisions on Protecting the Environment and Indigenous Cultures:** The amendment introduced two new articles. **Article 18A** was added, which directs the state to protect and improve the environment and to preserve biodiversity. **Article 23A** was added, which directs the state to take measures to protect and develop the unique local culture and tradition of the tribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and communities.
5.  **Making Basic Provisions Unamendable:** The amendment inserted a new article, **Article 7B**, which declared that certain fundamental provisions of the Constitution—including the Preamble, all articles in Part I (The Republic), Part II (Fundamental Principles), and Part III (Fundamental Rights), among others—are "basic provisions" of the Constitution and shall not be amendable by way of insertion, modification, substitution, repeal, or by any other means.

### **5. (d) How is a parliamentary government formed?**

A parliamentary government, also known as a parliamentary democracy or cabinet government, is a system of democratic governance where the executive branch derives its democratic legitimacy from, and is held accountable to, the legislature (the parliament).

The formation of a parliamentary government typically follows these steps:

1.  **General Election:** The process begins with a general election in which citizens vote to elect their representatives to the parliament. In most parliamentary systems, voters cast their vote for a candidate in their local constituency, and the candidate is usually a member of a political party.
2.  **Formation of a Majority:** After the election results are declared, the goal is to form a government that commands the confidence (i.e., the support of a majority of the members) of the parliament.
    *   **Single-Party Majority:** If a single political party wins an absolute majority of the seats in the parliament, that party has the clear right to form the government.
    *   **Coalition Government:** If no single party wins a majority, two or more parties may negotiate and agree to join together to form a **coalition government**. Their combined number of seats gives them the required majority in the parliament.
3.  **Appointment of the Prime Minister:** The Head of State (who is often a ceremonial figure, such as a President or a Monarch) formally invites the leader of the majority party or the leader of the majority coalition to form the government and appoints him or her as the **Prime Minister** (or Premier/Chancellor). The Prime Minister is the head of government and the chief executive.
4.  **Formation of the Cabinet:** The Prime Minister then selects other members of the government, known as ministers, to head the various government departments (e.g., Minister of Finance, Minister of Foreign Affairs). These ministers are almost always chosen from among the elected members of the Prime Minister's own party or the coalition partner parties in the parliament. The Prime Minister and these ministers together form the **Cabinet**, which is the principal executive and policy-making body of the government.
5.  **Accountability to Parliament:** The newly formed government (the Prime Minister and the Cabinet) is collectively responsible to the parliament. It must retain the "confidence" of the parliament to remain in power. If the government loses a vote of no-confidence in the parliament, it must resign, leading to the formation of a new government or a new general election.

Of course. Here are the detailed, essay-style answers for the remaining questions (6 through 10) from the "Bangladesh Affairs" examination paper.

***

### **6. (a) How is the Election Commission of Bangladesh formed? What are its main functions?**

The Election Commission (EC) of Bangladesh is a constitutionally mandated, independent body responsible for conducting the nation's elections. Its formation and functions are outlined in Part VII of the Constitution.

**Formation (Article 118):**

1.  **Composition:** The Election Commission consists of a **Chief Election Commissioner (CEC)** and not more than four other **Election Commissioners**.
2.  **Appointing Authority:** The President of Bangladesh appoints the CEC and other commissioners.
3.  **Appointment Process (Based on Law and Convention):** The Constitution (Article 118(1)) states that the appointment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of a law enacted by Parliament. In 2022, the "Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners Appointment Act" was passed. This law provides for the formation of a **Search Committee** (comprising judges, constitutional post-holders, and eminent citizens) which recommends a panel of names to the President for appointment. The President then makes the final appointments from this recommended list.
4.  **Term of Office:** The term of office for the commissioners is **five years** from the date on which they enter office. A person is not eligible to be a commissioner for more than two terms.

**Main Functions (Article 119):**

The main functions of the Election Commission are comprehensive and crucial for the democratic process:
1.  **Conducting Elections:** Its primary function is to hold elections for the office of the President and for the members of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament).
2.  **Preparing Electoral Rolls:** The EC is responsible for the superintendence, direction, and control of the preparation of the electoral rolls (voter lists) for these elections.
3.  **Delimitation of Constituencies:** The EC is responsible for delimiting the boundaries of the constituencies for the purpose of elections to Parliament.
4.  **Conducting Local Government Elections:** The EC is also tasked with holding elections to all tiers of local government bodies (e.g., City Corporations, Paurashavas, Upazila Parishads, and Union Parishads).
5.  **Other Functions:** The EC performs all other functions as may be prescribed by the Constitution or any other law, which includes tasks like registering political parties and enforcing the electoral code of conduct.

### **6. (b) What are the functions of the Attorney-General? Discuss briefly.**

The Attorney-General for Bangladesh is the principal law officer of the Republic, a crucial constitutional post established under Article 64 of the Constitution.

The functions of the Attorney-General can be discussed as follows:

1.  **Chief Legal Advisor to the Government:** The primary function of the Attorney-General is to act as the chief legal advisor to the government. He or she provides legal opinions to the President and the government on complex legal and constitutional issues referred to them.
2.  **Representation of the State in Courts:** The Attorney-General has the right of audience in all courts of Bangladesh. His most visible and critical duty is to **represent the state in all legal proceedings**, especially in vital constitutional, civil, and criminal matters before the Supreme Court (both the Appellate Division and the High Court Division). The Attorney-General's office defends the government's actions and policies when they are challenged in court.
3.  **Performing Assigned Duties:** According to the Constitution, the Attorney-General shall perform such other duties of a legal character as may be assigned to him by the President. This is a broad mandate that can include tasks like vetting draft laws and international agreements, and representing Bangladesh in international legal forums if required.
4.  **Supervision of Public Prosecutors:** By convention and practice, the Attorney-General's office supervises the work of other government law officers, such as Deputy Attorney-Generals and Assistant Attorney-Generals, who represent the state in various courts across the country.

In brief, the Attorney-General acts as the government's lawyer-in-chief, responsible for providing legal counsel to the state and representing its interests in the nation's judicial system.

### **6. (c) Explain the importance of the Ombudsman in Bangladesh.**

The office of the Ombudsman (*Nyaypal*) is a constitutional post provided for in **Article 77** of the Constitution of Bangladesh. Although the provision has existed since the constitution's inception in 1972, the office has never been made functional. However, the importance of establishing an Ombudsman is immense for ensuring good governance, accountability, and justice in the country.

The importance can be explained as follows:

1.  **Redressing Citizen Grievances against the Administration:** The primary importance of an Ombudsman lies in its role as an independent and impartial grievance redressal mechanism for ordinary citizens. It would provide an accessible, inexpensive, and swift avenue for citizens to lodge complaints against **maladministration** by any public official or government agency. Maladministration includes acts of corruption, abuse of power, negligence, inefficiency, and injustice.
2.  **Promoting Administrative Accountability and Transparency:** The Ombudsman would have the power to investigate these complaints, inspect government offices, and scrutinize official documents. The very existence of such an independent investigative body would act as a powerful deterrent against arbitrary and corrupt practices within the bureaucracy. It would make public servants more accountable for their actions and promote a culture of transparency in public administration.
3.  **Bridging the Gap between Citizens and the State:** The Ombudsman can act as a bridge between the citizens and the state. It provides a "people's tribune" where individuals who feel wronged by the vast machinery of the state can have their cases heard and investigated without the complexities and costs of going to a formal court of law.
4.  **Reducing the Burden on the Judiciary:** By handling a large volume of complaints related to administrative injustice, a functional Ombudsman's office would significantly reduce the caseload of the formal court system, allowing the judiciary to focus on more complex legal matters.

In essence, activating the office of the Ombudsman is crucial for strengthening democracy and good governance in Bangladesh. It would empower citizens, hold the executive accountable, and help to create a more responsive and just public administration.

### **6. (d) Present a picture of the progressive changes in the election expenditure for a member of parliament in Bangladesh since 2001.**

The limit on election expenditure for a Member of Parliament (MP) candidate in Bangladesh has undergone progressive changes, reflecting an attempt to curb the influence of money in politics. The law governing this is the Representation of the People Order (RPO), 1972.

A picture of the changes in the expenditure ceiling since 2001 is as follows:

*   **Before 2008:** Prior to the reforms leading up to the 2008 election, the official expenditure limit was **Tk. 5 lakh (500,000)**. However, this limit was widely seen as unrealistically low and was almost universally violated, with actual spending often running into crores.
*   **2008 Ninth Parliamentary Election:** Ahead of this election, the RPO was significantly amended. The expenditure ceiling was raised substantially to a more realistic figure of **Tk. 15 lakh (1,500,000)**. This was a major change aimed at encouraging candidates to be more truthful in their official expenditure statements.
*   **2014 Tenth Parliamentary Election:** For this election, the limit was further increased. The ceiling for an MP candidate was raised to **Tk. 25 lakh (2,500,000)**. This adjustment was made to account for inflation and the rising costs of campaigning.
*   **2018 Eleventh Parliamentary Election:** The limit of **Tk. 25 lakh** set in 2014 was retained for the 2018 general election and remains the current ceiling.

This progressive increase in the official expenditure limit represents a pragmatic approach by the Election Commission and lawmakers. The rationale is that by setting a more realistic ceiling, it becomes more feasible to monitor and enforce the limit. However, despite these changes, the challenge of controlling actual campaign spending and preventing the influence of "black money" in elections remains a significant issue in Bangladesh's political landscape.

***

### **7. (a) Give a description of the constitutional powers of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.**

In the parliamentary system of government of Bangladesh, the Prime Minister is the chief executive and the center of all executive authority. While the President is the Head of State, the real powers of governance are exercised by or on the advice of the Prime Minister. The constitutional powers of the Prime Minister are vast and are derived primarily from Articles 55, 56, and 58 of the Constitution.

The powers can be described as follows:

1.  **Head of Government and Chief Executive:** As stated in Article 55(2), the executive power of the Republic shall be exercised by or on the authority of the Prime Minister. He/she is the head of the government and presides over the Cabinet.
2.  **Power to Form and Lead the Cabinet:** The Prime Minister has the sole prerogative to form the Cabinet. He/she advises the President on the appointment of other Ministers, Ministers of State, and Deputy Ministers. The Prime Minister also allocates portfolios (departments) among the ministers and can ask for any minister's resignation or advise the President to dismiss them.
3.  **Leader of the House in Parliament:** By convention, the Prime Minister is the Leader of the House in the Jatiya Sangsad. In this capacity, he/she leads the business of the government in Parliament, makes major policy announcements, and is responsible for steering the government's legislative agenda through the House.
4.  **Principal Advisor to the President:** The Prime Minister is the principal channel of communication between the Cabinet and the President. It is his/her duty to keep the President informed on all matters of domestic and foreign policy and to advise the President on the exercise of his/her functions. Except for the appointment of the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice, the President is constitutionally bound to act in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice.
5.  **Power of Appointment:** The Prime Minister advises the President on all major constitutional and administrative appointments, including the appointment of Supreme Court judges, the Attorney-General, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Chairman and members of the Election Commission and the Public Service Commission, and chiefs of the armed services.
6.  **Power to Advise Dissolution of Parliament:** The Prime Minister has the power to advise the President to dissolve the Jatiya Sangsad at any time, which can trigger a fresh general election.

In essence, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh holds the ultimate executive authority of the state, controlling the cabinet, leading the parliament, and directing the entire machinery of the government.

### **7. (b) Write about the composition of the legislature of Bangladesh.**

The legislature of Bangladesh is known as the **Jatiya Sangsad** (House of the Nation). As established by Part V of the Constitution, it is a **unicameral** legislature, meaning it consists of a single house.

The composition of the Jatiya Sangsad is as follows:

1.  **Total Number of Seats:** The Jatiya Sangsad consists of **350 members**.
2.  **Directly Elected Members:** **300 members** are directly elected by the people from 300 single-territorial constituencies across the country. The election is held on the basis of universal adult franchise (all citizens aged 18 and above are eligible to vote), and the candidate who receives the highest number of votes in a constituency (the "first-past-the-post" system) is declared the winner.
3.  **Reserved Seats for Women:** **50 seats** are reserved exclusively for women. These women members are not directly elected by the general public. Instead, they are elected by the 300 directly elected members of the Jatiya Sangsad. The seats are allocated to the political parties in proportion to the number of general seats they have won in the election.
4.  **Speaker and Deputy Speaker:** The Jatiya Sangsad elects from among its members a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker to preside over its sittings and conduct its proceedings.
5.  **Term of Parliament:** The term of the Jatiya Sangsad is **five years** from the date of its first meeting, unless it is dissolved earlier by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.

### **7. (c) Briefly write about the importance of the Rules of Procedure in conducting the business of the Jatiya Sangsad.**

The **Rules of Procedure of Parliament** are the detailed set of rules and regulations that govern the day-to-day business and proceedings of the Jatiya Sangsad. While the Constitution provides the broad framework, the Rules of Procedure provide the operational blueprint for how the Parliament actually functions. Their importance is immense for ensuring orderly, fair, and effective legislative work.

The importance can be briefly stated as follows:

1.  **Ensuring Orderly Conduct:** The Rules of Procedure establish the detailed process for conducting debates, maintaining decorum, and managing the time of the House. They give the Speaker the authority to maintain order and discipline, preventing the proceedings from descending into chaos.
2.  **Facilitating Legislative Business:** The rules lay down the precise step-by-step process for the introduction, debate, amendment, and passage of a bill. This ensures that all legislation is considered in a structured and systematic manner.
3.  **Upholding the Rights of Members:** The rules protect the rights and privileges of all members of Parliament, including those in the opposition. They provide specific mechanisms through which MPs can participate, such as the right to ask questions (Question Hour), move motions, and initiate discussions on matters of urgent public importance. This ensures that the voice of the opposition and individual members can be heard.
4.  **Holding the Executive Accountable:** The Rules of Procedure provide the key instruments for parliamentary oversight of the executive branch. Mechanisms like Question Hour, adjournment motions, calling attention notices, and the detailed examination of ministry activities by Parliamentary Standing Committees are all defined and regulated by these rules. They are the tools that enable the legislature to fulfill its constitutional duty of holding the government accountable.

In essence, the Rules of Procedure are the lifeblood of a functioning parliament. They transform constitutional principles into practical reality, ensuring that the Jatiya Sangsad can conduct its business in an orderly, democratic, and effective manner.

### **7. (d) Write about the composition of the High Court of Bangladesh.**

The High Court of Bangladesh is not a separate court but is a **Division** of the **Supreme Court of Bangladesh**. The Supreme Court, as established by Part VI of the Constitution, consists of two divisions:
1.  The Appellate Division
2.  The High Court Division

Therefore, the "High Court" is correctly referred to as the **High Court Division**.

**Composition (Article 94):**

1.  **Chief Justice and Other Judges:** The High Court Division consists of the **Chief Justice of Bangladesh** and such number of other **Judges** as the President may deem it necessary to appoint to this Division.
2.  **Appointment:** All judges of the High Court Division, including the Chief Justice, are appointed by the President of Bangladesh. For the appointment of judges other than the Chief Justice, the President is required to consult with the Chief Justice.
3.  **Qualifications:** To be appointed as a Judge of the High Court Division, a person must be a citizen of Bangladesh and must have been an advocate of the Supreme Court for at least ten years, OR have held a judicial office for at least ten years.
4.  **Benches:** The High Court Division conducts its business through various "benches." The Chief Justice has the authority to constitute different benches, which can consist of a single judge (Single Bench) or two judges (Division Bench), to hear and decide different types of cases. The Chief Justice assigns cases to the different benches.

The High Court Division is the court of first instance for certain matters, such as writ petitions for the enforcement of fundamental rights, and also serves as the principal court of appeal from the subordinate civil and criminal courts across the country.

***
Of course. Here are the detailed, essay-style answers for the remaining questions (8, 9, and 10) from the "Bangladesh Affairs" examination paper.

***

### **8. (a) What are the basic principles of Bangladesh's foreign policy?**

The basic principles of Bangladesh's foreign policy are clearly articulated in **Article 25** of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. These principles are rooted in the historical experience of the 1971 Liberation War and reflect the nation's aspiration to be a peaceful, sovereign, and responsible member of the international community. The overarching principle is famously encapsulated in the motto: **"Friendship to all, malice towards none."**

The core principles are:

1.  **Respect for National Sovereignty and Equality:** The state shall base its international relations on the principles of respect for the national sovereignty and equality of all nations.
2.  **Non-interference in Internal Affairs:** Bangladesh is committed to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and expects the same in return.
3.  **Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes:** The state shall endeavor to settle all international disputes by peaceful means, such as negotiation, mediation, or arbitration.
4.  **Respect for International Law and UN Charter Principles:** Bangladesh shall respect the principles of international law and the principles enunciated in the United Nations Charter.
5.  **Striving for Disarmament:** The state shall strive for the renunciation of the use of force in international relations and for general and complete disarmament.
6.  **Support for Self-Determination and Anti-Colonialism:** Upholding the right of every people freely to determine and build up its own social, economic, and political system, the state shall support oppressed peoples throughout the world waging a just struggle against imperialism, colonialism, or racialism.
7.  **Promotion of International Peace and Solidarity:** The ultimate goal is to consolidate, preserve, and strengthen fraternal relations among Muslim countries and to foster solidarity with other nations to promote international peace, security, and cooperation.

These principles collectively form a foreign policy that is peaceful, non-aligned, and progressive, focused on safeguarding national independence while promoting global cooperation and justice.

### **8. (b) "The preservation of national interest is the main determinant of Bangladesh's foreign policy." - Explain.**

This statement is fundamentally correct. While Bangladesh's foreign policy is guided by the noble constitutional principles of peace and international cooperation, in the pragmatic world of international relations, the primary and overriding determinant of any nation's foreign policy is the **preservation and promotion of its national interest**. For Bangladesh, "national interest" encompasses a range of core objectives that are vital for its survival, well-being, and development as a sovereign state.

The explanation is as follows:

1.  **Core National Interest: Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity:** The foremost national interest is the preservation of the country's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. All foreign policy decisions—from forming diplomatic ties to signing treaties—are first and foremost evaluated on whether they enhance or compromise this core interest.
2.  **Economic Development as a Key Interest:** For a developing nation like Bangladesh, economic development is a paramount national interest. Therefore, a major thrust of its foreign policy is "economic diplomacy." This involves:
    *   Securing and expanding export markets for its products (especially RMG).
    *   Attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
    *   Ensuring favorable trade terms and development assistance.
    *   Protecting the welfare of its large expatriate workforce and the flow of remittances.
    All foreign policy actions are geared towards creating an external environment that is conducive to achieving these economic goals.
3.  **Ensuring Security (Both Traditional and Non-Traditional):** The national interest dictates that Bangladesh must secure itself from both traditional military threats and non-traditional security threats. This involves maintaining good relations with its neighbors (especially India and Myanmar) to ensure border security, as well as actively engaging in international forums to address non-traditional threats like climate change, which poses an existential risk to the nation.
4.  **Pragmatic Application of Principles:** The constitutional principles are not abandoned, but are applied pragmatically in service of the national interest. For instance, the principle of "friendship to all" is pragmatically applied to maintain good relations with rival major powers like India, China, and the United States simultaneously, in order to maximize economic and strategic benefits from all sides without becoming entangled in their conflicts.

In conclusion, while the ideals of the constitution provide the moral compass, the practical direction of Bangladesh's foreign policy is determined by a hard-headed assessment of its national interests. The pursuit of economic prosperity, security, and sovereign autonomy are the primary drivers that shape its engagement with the rest of the world.

### **8. (c) Briefly highlight the importance of Bangladesh's participation in UN Peacekeeping Missions from an economic perspective.**

From an economic perspective, Bangladesh's extensive participation in United Nations Peacekeeping Missions provides several significant and tangible benefits to the nation.

1.  **Source of Foreign Exchange Earnings:** This is the most direct economic benefit. The United Nations reimburses troop-contributing countries for their personnel and for the equipment they deploy in missions. This payment is made in foreign currency (US dollars). For Bangladesh, these reimbursements constitute a substantial and steady inflow of foreign exchange, which contributes to strengthening the country's foreign currency reserves.
2.  **Individual Remittances and Poverty Alleviation:** The individual peacekeepers (soldiers and police officers) receive allowances and salaries from the UN that are significantly higher than their regular pay. A large portion of this income is sent back home to their families as remittances. This not only improves the economic well-being of thousands of individual families, helping to alleviate poverty, but also boosts consumption and investment in the local economy.
3.  **Professional Development and Skill Enhancement:** While not a direct financial inflow, the professional experience gained by the peacekeepers is a valuable economic asset. They receive training in modern logistics, communication, engineering, and medical services. This enhanced skill set makes the Bangladesh Armed Forces a more modern and capable institution, and many of these skills have valuable applications in national development projects upon their return.
4.  **"Branding" Bangladesh and Economic Diplomacy:** The positive international reputation earned by Bangladeshi peacekeepers for their professionalism and compassion enhances the country's "brand image" globally. This soft power can have indirect economic benefits, creating a favorable climate for attracting foreign investment and promoting trade, as it portrays Bangladesh as a responsible and reliable member of the international community.

### **8. (d) What is meant by BCIM? Briefly explain its main significance in enhancing regional cooperation.**

**BCIM** stands for the **Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar** Economic Corridor. It is a proposed multi-modal transport corridor that aims to connect Kunming in China's Yunnan province with Kolkata in India, running through Mandalay and Lashio in Myanmar and passing through Dhaka and Chattogram in Bangladesh.

**Main Significance in Enhancing Regional Cooperation:**

The BCIM Economic Corridor is envisioned as a transformative initiative with immense significance for enhancing regional cooperation.
1.  **Fostering Economic Integration and Trade:** The primary significance of the corridor is its potential to create a vibrant, integrated economic zone connecting three major economies: China, India, and the dynamic markets of Southeast Asia, with Bangladesh at its hub. By significantly reducing transport costs and travel time, it would dramatically boost cross-border trade, investment, and the development of regional supply chains.
2.  **Positioning Bangladesh as a Regional Hub:** For Bangladesh, the corridor is of huge strategic importance. It would physically connect Bangladesh with the vast markets of southwestern China and India's northeastern states. This would position Bangladesh not as a peripheral country, but as a crucial transport and manufacturing hub at the crossroads of South and Southeast Asia.
3.  **Promoting People-to-People Contact and Development:** Beyond trade, the corridor aims to enhance people-to-people contact, tourism, and cultural exchange among the four countries. The development of infrastructure along the corridor is also expected to spur economic growth and poverty reduction in the underdeveloped regions through which it passes.
4.  **Building Trust and Cooperation:** The BCIM initiative, by focusing on the shared economic benefits of connectivity, has the potential to act as a confidence-building measure. It could encourage greater cooperation and help to manage the strategic mistrust that often exists between major powers like India and China, creating a win-win situation for all four participating nations.

***

### **9. (a) What type of party system exists in Bangladesh? Briefly explain.**

Bangladesh has a **multi-party system** of government, which is constitutionally guaranteed. However, in practice, the political landscape since the restoration of democracy in 1991 has been overwhelmingly dominated by two major political parties and their respective alliances, leading to a system that can be best described as a **bipolar or two-party dominant multi-party system**.

**Brief Explanation:**
*   **Multi-Party System (De Jure):** Legally and constitutionally, there are no restrictions on the number of political parties that can be formed and can contest elections. The Election Commission has numerous registered political parties, ranging across the ideological spectrum from left to right to Islamist.
*   **Two-Party Dominance (De Facto):** In reality, the political power has consistently revolved around two major political parties: the **Awami League (AL)** and the **Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)**. These two parties have alternated in power and have been the only parties with a realistic chance of forming a government.
*   **Alliance-Based Bipolarity:** The dominance of these two parties has been further consolidated through the formation of large political alliances. The political competition has not just been between two parties, but between two grand coalitions: the **Grand Alliance (Mohajot)** led by the Awami League, and the **20-Party Alliance** (previously the 4-Party Alliance) led by the BNP. Smaller parties exist and contest elections, but their political relevance is largely defined by their alignment with one of these two major blocs.

This bipolar, confrontational political system has been a defining feature of Bangladesh's democracy for the past three decades.

### **9. (b) Briefly explain the significance of dropping the word 'Muslim' from the 'Awami Muslim League' in 1955.**

The decision to drop the word 'Muslim' from the name of the 'Awami Muslim League' to become simply the **'Awami League'** at its council session in 1955 was a momentous and ideologically significant event in the political history of Bangladesh.

The significance was twofold:
1.  **Embracing Secular and Inclusive Politics:** This act signified a clear and deliberate ideological shift from a communal, religion-based political platform to a **secular, inclusive, and mass-oriented one**. By removing the word 'Muslim', the party officially opened its doors to all citizens of East Bengal, regardless of their religion, including the significant Hindu minority and other communities. It was a formal rejection of the religion-based politics of the Muslim League, which had led the Pakistan movement.
2.  **Laying the Foundation for Bengali Nationalism:** This move was a crucial step in the evolution of **Bengali nationalism**. It signaled that the party's primary identity and political basis would be the shared language, culture, and secular interests of the Bengali people, rather than a shared religious identity. This secular, linguistic-nationalist platform was what allowed the Awami League to unite all Bengalis and eventually lead the movement for autonomy and, ultimately, independence.

In essence, this name change was not merely symbolic; it was a foundational act that transformed the party into a true people's league (*Awami League*) and set it on the path of secular nationalism that would define the future politics of Bangladesh.

### **9. (c) Briefly describe the functions of a political party in Bangladesh.**

In the democratic system of Bangladesh, political parties perform several crucial functions that are essential for the functioning of the state and the political process.

The main functions are:
1.  **Interest Aggregation and Articulation:** Political parties aggregate the diverse interests, demands, and grievances of various groups within society (e.g., farmers, workers, business communities) and articulate them into a coherent set of policies and a political program.
2.  **Political Mobilization and Participation:** Parties are the primary instruments for mobilizing citizens to participate in the political process. They conduct rallies, meetings, and campaigns to raise public awareness, and they encourage people to vote and engage in political life.
3.  **Contesting Elections and Forming Governments:** The most visible function of political parties is to nominate candidates to contest elections. The party that wins a majority of seats in the Jatiya Sangsad forms the government and gets the opportunity to implement its policies.
4.  **Political Recruitment and Leadership Training:** Political parties serve as the primary recruiting ground for political leaders. They identify, train, and groom individuals for public office, from the local government level to the national cabinet.
5.  **Forming an Opposition and Ensuring Accountability:** The party or parties that do not form the government play the vital role of the opposition. The opposition's function is to scrutinize the actions of the government, critique its policies, highlight its failures, and present itself as an alternative government, thereby holding the ruling party accountable to the people and the parliament.

### **9. (d) What are the notable characteristics of opposition party politics in Bangladesh since 1991?**

The politics of the opposition party in Bangladesh since the restoration of democracy in 1991 has been characterized by a distinct and often problematic set of features.

The notable characteristics are:
1.  **Confrontational and Extra-Parliamentary Politics:** The most defining characteristic has been a preference for **confrontational street agitation** over constructive debate within the Parliament. Opposition parties have frequently resorted to disruptive tactics like *hartals* (general strikes) and *oborodh* (transport blockades) to challenge the government, often leading to political violence and economic disruption.
2.  **Boycotting Parliament:** There has been a recurring tendency for the main opposition party to boycott the sessions of the Jatiya Sangsad for extended periods. This practice, often done to protest alleged electoral rigging or government actions, weakens the Parliament as an institution and deprives the opposition of its primary platform for holding the government accountable.
3.  **Rejection of Election Results:** A consistent feature has been the refusal of the losing major party/alliance to accept the results of the general election, immediately alleging widespread fraud and demanding the resignation of the government. This has contributed to a deep-seated political mistrust and has made the peaceful transfer of power a contentious issue.
4.  **Demand for a Neutral Caretaker Government:** For a long period, the central political demand of the opposition was the holding of elections under a neutral, non-party caretaker government. The politics of the opposition was heavily focused on agitations to realize this demand.
5.  **Personalized and Vituperative Rivalry:** The opposition politics has often been characterized less by ideological or policy-based debate and more by an intense and personalized rivalry between the leaders of the two main parties. This has fueled a culture of extreme political intolerance and has made consensus-building on national issues extremely difficult.

### **10. Write short notes on (any four):**

**(a) International Labor Market and Bangladesh**

The international labor market is a critical pillar of the Bangladeshi economy. It refers to the global demand for and supply of labor, in which millions of Bangladeshi citizens participate as migrant workers. Bangladesh is one of the world's largest manpower-exporting countries.

The relationship is characterized by:
*   **Massive Outflow of Labor:** Every year, hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis migrate for work, primarily to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar) and to Southeast Asian countries (like Malaysia and Singapore). They are employed in a wide range of sectors, from construction and agriculture to services.
*   **Remittances as a Lifeline:** The single most important outcome of this participation is the huge inflow of **remittances**. This money, sent home by the workers, is the second-largest source of foreign exchange for Bangladesh and plays a vital role in maintaining macroeconomic stability, reducing poverty, and boosting domestic consumption.
*   **Challenges:** The sector faces significant challenges, including the exploitation of workers by recruiting agencies, the prevalence of low-skilled jobs, and the vulnerability of workers in host countries. A key policy goal for Bangladesh is to move from exporting low-skilled labor to exporting skilled and semi-skilled manpower to increase remittance earnings and ensure worker welfare.

**(b) Bangladesh and the World Trade Organization (WTO)**

The relationship between Bangladesh and the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body that regulates international trade, is of immense strategic importance for the country's economic development.

*   **Beneficiary of Special Treatment:** As a Least Developed Country (LDC), Bangladesh has been a major beneficiary of the WTO's principle of **Special and Differential Treatment**. This has granted its exports, particularly its vital Ready-Made Garments (RMG), **Duty-Free Quota-Free (DFQF)** market access to developed countries, most notably the European Union. This preferential access was a key catalyst for the phenomenal growth of the RMG sector.
*   **Use of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism:** Bangladesh has used the WTO's platforms to defend its trade interests.
*   **Challenges of LDC Graduation:** The most significant current issue is Bangladesh's impending graduation from LDC status (projected for 2026). Upon graduation, it will lose its preferential market access. Therefore, a key foreign policy objective for Bangladesh within the WTO is to negotiate a smooth transition, secure an extension of these benefits for a period, diversify its export basket, and enhance its competitiveness to thrive in a more challenging global market.

**(c) World Cricket and Bangladesh**

Cricket is not just a sport in Bangladesh; it is a source of immense national pride, passion, and unity. Bangladesh's journey in world cricket is a story of remarkable progress and resilience.

*   **Test Status and Rise:** Bangladesh was granted full Test-playing status by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2000, becoming the tenth Test nation. After a difficult initial decade, the Bangladesh national cricket team, popularly known as the "Tigers," has emerged as a formidable force in international cricket, especially in the One-Day International (ODI) format.
*   **Major Achievements:** Notable achievements include reaching the quarter-finals of the 2015 Cricket World Cup, the semi-finals of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, and winning numerous bilateral series at home against top-ranked teams like India, Pakistan, South Africa, and England.
*   **Global Stars and Domestic Structure:** Bangladesh has produced world-class players like Shakib Al Hasan, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders in the history of the game. The establishment of the **Bangladesh Premier League (BPL)**, a professional franchise-based Twenty20 league, has further boosted the sport's profile and provided a platform for local talent. In world cricket, Bangladesh is recognized for its passionate and massive fan base.

**(d) Quota in Government Jobs**

The quota system in government jobs in Bangladesh has been a long-standing and highly debated system of affirmative action. It was designed to ensure representation in public service for various segments of the population.

*   **Historical Structure:** For many years, a significant portion of government jobs were reserved under a complex quota system. The major quotas included:
    *   **Freedom Fighter Quota:** 30% reserved for the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters.
    *   **District Quota:** 10% based on a candidate's home district.
    *   **Women's Quota:** 10% reserved for women.
    *   **Ethnic Minorities Quota:** 5% for indigenous and other minority communities.
    This meant that 56% of all government recruitment was done through quotas, with only 44% being based on pure merit.
*   **Reform and Abolition:** This system faced widespread criticism for being discriminatory and for hindering the recruitment of meritorious candidates. In 2018, following a massive student-led protest movement, the government made a landmark decision to **abolish the quota system in the recruitment for all first and second-class government jobs** (Grade 9 to 13). Recruitment for these posts is now done almost entirely on the basis of merit. However, quotas for third and fourth-class jobs and for specific groups like persons with disabilities remain in place.

**(e) Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in Bangladesh**

Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is a government policy and a mechanism for developing public infrastructure and services through a long-term partnership between the government (the public sector) and private sector companies. It is being increasingly used in Bangladesh to bridge the massive infrastructure financing gap.

*   **Rationale:** The government often lacks the financial resources and technical expertise to implement all the large-scale infrastructure projects the country needs. The PPP model aims to leverage the private sector's efficiency, innovation, and capital to deliver these projects more quickly and effectively.
*   **Institutional Framework:** To facilitate this, the government has established the **PPP Authority** under the Prime Minister's Office. This body acts as a central agency to support the procurement, negotiation, and implementation of PPP projects.
*   **Examples of PPP Projects:** The PPP model is being applied in various sectors, including the construction of economic zones, highways and expressways, sea and land ports, IT parks, and projects in the health and tourism sectors.
*   **Challenges:** The success of PPPs in Bangladesh faces challenges, including ensuring transparency in the bidding process, creating a stable and predictable regulatory environment to attract private investors, and developing a robust legal framework for contract enforcement.

**(f) E-governance and Bangladesh**

E-governance, or electronic governance, refers to the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to deliver government services and information to the public, businesses, and other government agencies. In Bangladesh, e-governance is a central component of the government's **"Digital Bangladesh"** vision.

*   **Goal:** The primary goal of e-governance is to make public service delivery more efficient, transparent, accessible, and less prone to corruption.
*   **Key Initiatives:** Several successful e-governance initiatives have been implemented:
    *   **Union Digital Centres (UDCs):** Over 8,000 one-stop digital service centers have been established at the union level, providing rural citizens with access to online services like birth registration, passport applications, and land records (e-porcha).
    *   **National Web Portal:** A single national portal has been created that integrates thousands of government websites, providing a central point for information and services.
    *   **E-Tendering:** The introduction of an electronic government procurement (e-GP) system has made the public procurement process more transparent and competitive.
    *   **Mobile Financial Services (MFS):** The government uses MFS platforms to directly disburse social safety net payments and stipends to beneficiaries, eliminating middlemen.
*   **Impact:** E-governance has significantly reduced the time, cost, and harassment (the "TCH" model of reform) faced by citizens in accessing public services, bringing governance closer to the people's doorsteps.

**(g) Bangladesh's Maritime Victory**

"Bangladesh's Maritime Victory" refers to the country's historic and peaceful resolution of its maritime boundary disputes with its two neighbors, **Myanmar and India**, through international legal arbitration.

*   **Victory against Myanmar (2012):** Bangladesh had a dispute with Myanmar over the demarcation of the maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal. The case was taken to the **International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)** in Hamburg, Germany. In March 2012, the tribunal delivered its verdict, which was overwhelmingly in favor of Bangladesh. It granted Bangladesh a full 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and a substantial share of the outer continental shelf.
*   **Victory against India (2014):** A similar dispute existed with India. This case was taken to the **Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)** in The Hague. In July 2014, the arbitral tribunal again awarded Bangladesh a vast sea area, recognizing its claim over a significant portion of the disputed territory.
*   **Significance:** These two legal victories were monumental diplomatic achievements. They peacefully and permanently established Bangladesh's sovereign rights over a vast sea area of over 118,000 square kilometers, rich in living and non-living resources. This has unlocked immense potential for Bangladesh to develop its **"Blue Economy"** by exploring for offshore oil and gas, sustainably managing its fisheries, and utilizing its sea lanes for trade.

**(h) Mineral Resources of Bangladesh**
*(This question is identical to 10(e) from the previous exam paper. The answer is replicated here for completeness.)*

Bangladesh is not endowed with a wide variety of metallic minerals, but it possesses significant deposits of non-metallic minerals and valuable energy resources, which are crucial for its industrial and economic development.

The principal mineral resources are:
1.  **Natural Gas:** This is the most important indigenous energy resource, forming the backbone of the country's power generation and fertilizer production. Major gas fields are located in the eastern part of the country.
2.  **Coal:** Significant reserves of high-quality bituminous coal are located in the northwestern region, with an operational mine at Barapukuria.
3.  **Hard Rock:** Deposits of hard rock (granite) are mined from Madhyapara in Dinajpur, essential for construction.
4.  **Limestone:** Used for manufacturing cement, it is found in Jaipurhat and on St. Martin's Island.
5.  **Silica Sand (Glass Sand):** The raw material for the glass industry, found in several districts.
6.  **White Clay (Kaolin):** Used in the ceramics and porcelain industry, with significant deposits in Bijoypur, Netrokona.
