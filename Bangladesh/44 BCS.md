### **Question 01**

#### **(a) Introduce the 'Mujibnagar Government' formed during the Liberation War of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

The Mujibnagar Government, formally known as the **Provisional Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh**, was the first government of Bangladesh, formed during the Liberation War in 1971. It served as the legitimate, supreme authority representing the Bengali nation's struggle for independence.

**Formation and Proclamation:**
Following the brutal crackdown by the Pakistani military on March 25, 1971, and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's declaration of independence, the need for a formal government to lead the war became imperative. On **April 10, 1971**, this provisional government was officially formed. It was formally proclaimed and took its oath of office on **April 17, 1971**, at Baidyanathtala, a mango grove in Meherpur, Kushtia district. This location was subsequently renamed **Mujibnagar** in honor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

**Structure of the Government:**
The government was structured to provide political leadership and coordinate the war effort:
*   **President:** **Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman** (who was imprisoned in Pakistan).
*   **Vice-President (and Acting President):** **Syed Nazrul Islam**.
*   **Prime Minister:** **Tajuddin Ahmad**.
*   **Minister of Finance, Commerce, and Industries:** **M. Mansur Ali**.
*   **Minister of Home Affairs, Relief, and Rehabilitation:** **A. H. M. Quamruzzaman**.
*   **Minister of Foreign Affairs and Law:** **Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad**.
*   **Commander-in-Chief, Mukti Bahini:** **Colonel (later General) M. A. G. Osmani**.

This government established its headquarters in exile in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, from where it directed the war, managed diplomatic relations, and organized support for the millions of refugees. It was the political embodiment of Bangladesh's sovereignty long before the final victory.

#### **(b) Analyze the contribution of the wartime Bangladesh Government in conducting the Liberation War.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**

The contribution of the Mujibnagar Government was foundational to the success of the Liberation War. It transformed an initially spontaneous popular resistance into an organized, internationally recognized struggle for national independence. Its contributions can be analyzed under several key areas:

1.  **Providing Political Legitimacy and Leadership:** The government's foremost contribution was providing a legitimate political authority. By forming a constitutional government, it nullified Pakistan's narrative of the conflict as a "secessionist movement" or an "internal matter." This legitimate leadership, acting in the name of the elected representatives from the 1970 election, was crucial for gaining international sympathy and eventual recognition.

2.  **Organizing the Armed Struggle:** The government systematically organized the armed forces. Under the command of General M. A. G. Osmani, the Mukti Bahini was formed. The entire country was strategically divided into **11 sectors** and various sub-sectors, each under a designated commander. The government established training camps, arranged for weapons and ammunition (with Indian assistance), and formulated the military strategy, which combined guerrilla warfare with conventional attacks by regular forces.

3.  **Conducting Global Diplomacy:** The Foreign Ministry under Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, and effectively led by Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad, launched a vigorous diplomatic campaign. Missions were sent to major world capitals, including London, Washington D.C., and Paris. Figures like Justice Abu Sayeed Chowdhury played a pivotal role at the UN. This diplomacy was instrumental in:
    *   Exposing the genocide committed by the Pakistani army.
    *   Gaining support from foreign governments, parliaments, and the global public.
    *   Isolating Pakistan on the world stage.
    *   Securing crucial support from India and the Soviet Union, which culminated in the **Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation (August 1971)**.

4.  **Administration and Civil Management:** The government established an administrative structure to manage the liberated zones and coordinate relief efforts. It ran the **Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra**, a radio station that served as a powerful tool for broadcasting war news, patriotic songs, and motivational programs, keeping the morale of the freedom fighters and the public high.

5.  **Managing the Refugee Crisis:** The government worked closely with India to manage the immense crisis of over **10 million Bengali refugees** who had fled to India. It coordinated relief efforts in refugee camps, drawing international attention and aid to the humanitarian catastrophe.

In essence, the Mujibnagar Government was the brain and heart of the Liberation War. It provided the strategic direction, military organization, diplomatic muscle, and administrative framework that successfully guided the nation to victory on December 16, 1971.

#### **(c) Can the wartime Bangladesh Government be called a government-in-exile?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

Yes, the wartime Bangladesh Government, or the Mujibnagar Government, can correctly be termed a **government-in-exile**. A government-in-exile is a political group that claims to be a country's legitimate government but is unable to exercise legal power from its own territory and instead resides in a foreign country. The Mujibnagar Government fits this definition perfectly for the following reasons:

1.  **Operation from Foreign Soil:** After its formal proclamation at Mujibnagar on April 17, 1971, the government established its functional headquarters at **8 Theatre Road, Calcutta (Kolkata), India**. From this location, it conducted all its major political, military, and diplomatic activities for the duration of the war.

2.  **Lack of Control over its Capital:** The legitimate capital, Dhaka, remained under the occupation of the Pakistani military throughout the war. The government could not operate from its own territory's seat of power.

3.  **Legitimate Claim to Sovereignty:** It was not a self-proclaimed rebel group. It was formed by the elected representatives of the people of East Pakistan from the **1970 general election**, where the Awami League won a landslide majority (167 out of 169 seats). This gave it a strong democratic and legitimate claim to be the sovereign authority of the Bengali nation.

4.  **Recognition and Function:** It functioned as a full-fledged government, with a President, Prime Minister, cabinet, and armed forces. It sought and eventually gained recognition from other states (India and Bhutan being the first), a key characteristic of a government-in-exile striving to establish its statehood.

Therefore, while its authority was rooted in the will of the Bangladeshi people and its activities extended into liberated zones within Bangladesh, its operational base was in a foreign country, making the term "government-in-exile" an accurate and appropriate description.

### **Question 02**

#### **(a) Explain - 'The Constitution is the supreme law of Bangladesh'.** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

The statement "The Constitution is the supreme law of Bangladesh" is a foundational principle of the country's legal and political system, explicitly enshrined in **Article 7(2)** of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. This principle of constitutional supremacy has several profound implications:

1.  **Source of All State Power:** The Constitution is the ultimate source from which all organs of the state—the executive, the legislature (Parliament), and the judiciary—derive their power and authority. No state organ can act beyond the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution.

2.  **Voidness of Inconsistent Laws:** Article 7(2) declares that any other law that is inconsistent with the Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be **void**. This means that if Parliament passes a law that violates any provision of the Constitution (especially the fundamental rights outlined in Part III), the Supreme Court has the power to declare that law unconstitutional and therefore null and void.

3.  **Hierarchy of Laws:** This principle establishes a clear hierarchy within the legal system. At the apex is the Constitution, followed by laws made by Parliament (Acts), and then subordinate legislation (rules, regulations, etc.). No subordinate law can contradict a law made by Parliament, and no Act of Parliament can contradict the Constitution.

4.  **Guardian of the Constitution:** The Supreme Court of Bangladesh acts as the guardian and interpreter of the Constitution. Through the power of **judicial review** (established under Article 102), it ensures that the executive and legislative branches act within their constitutional limits, thereby upholding the supremacy of the Constitution.

In summary, the Constitution is not merely a law but the supreme law that creates the state, defines its powers, limits its authority, guarantees citizens' rights, and provides the ultimate standard against which the legality of all other laws and government actions is judged.

### **Question 10: Write short notes (any four): (5x4 = 20)**

#### **(a) The 7th March Speech**

**Answer:**

The 7th March Speech was a historic address delivered by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on **March 7, 1971**, at the Ramna Race Course (now Suhrawardy Udyan) in Dhaka. Delivered to a gathering of over two million people, this speech is widely regarded as the de facto declaration of Bangladesh's independence.

In the 19-minute extempore speech, Bangabandhu masterfully articulated the Bengali nation's demand for self-determination amidst the political crisis following the 1970 election. He outlined a program of non-cooperation and civil disobedience against the Pakistani regime but stopped short of a unilateral declaration of independence to avoid being branded a secessionist and inviting immediate, large-scale military violence.

The most iconic lines of the speech encapsulated its dual message of a final warning and a call to arms: *"Ebarer shongram amader muktir shongram, ebarer shongram shadhinotar shongram"* ("The struggle this time is for our emancipation, the struggle this time is for our independence").

The speech was a political masterpiece that simultaneously provided a clear roadmap for the struggle ahead, united the entire Bengali nation, and served as the ultimate inspiration for the Liberation War that commenced 18 days later. In **2017**, **UNESCO** recognized the speech as a part of the **Memory of the World Register**, acknowledging its immense historical significance as a key documentary heritage.

#### **(c) Liberation War Museum**

**Answer:**

The **Liberation War Museum (Muktijuddho Jadughor)** is a museum located in Agargaon, Dhaka, dedicated to preserving and commemorating the history of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. It was established in 1996 through the initiative of a group of private citizens to ensure that the memory of the struggle for independence and the sacrifices made would not be forgotten.

The museum serves several vital functions:
1.  **Preservation of Artifacts:** It houses a vast collection of over **21,000 artifacts** related to the war, including documents, photographs, personal belongings of martyrs, weapons used by freedom fighters and the Pakistani army, and evidence of the genocide.
2.  **Education and Awareness:** The exhibits are arranged chronologically, providing visitors with a powerful narrative of the Bengali nationalist movement, the 1971 genocide, the nine-month armed struggle, and the final victory. It is a crucial educational resource for the younger generation.
3.  **Documentation of Genocide:** The museum plays a critical role in documenting the atrocities committed during the war. Its archives include oral histories from freedom fighters, survivors, and witnesses, which are invaluable for research and for seeking justice and recognition of the genocide.
4.  **Promoting Secular and Democratic Values:** By highlighting a history rooted in the fight for democracy, human rights, and secularism, the museum promotes the core values upon which Bangladesh was founded.

Initially located in a small rented building, the museum moved to its own purpose-built, modern premises in 2017. It stands as a powerful testament to the nation's struggle and a solemn memorial to the millions who sacrificed their lives for independence.

#### **(d) Mangal Shobhajatra**

**Answer:**

**Mangal Shobhajatra** (meaning "Procession for Well-being") is a vibrant mass procession that takes place at dawn on the first day of the Bengali New Year, **Pahela Baishakh**, in Bangladesh. The tradition was initiated in **1989** by students and teachers of the **Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka**, as a way to unite people and protest against the autocratic rule of the time, symbolically driving away evil spirits and welcoming a new year of peace and prosperity.

Key features of the procession include:
*   **Colorful Masks and Floats:** Participants carry large, colorful, handcrafted replicas of birds, fish, animals, and other motifs representing Bengali culture and folklore. Giant masks symbolizing both good and evil are a central feature.
*   **Symbolism of Unity and Secularism:** The procession is a celebration of Bengali cultural identity that transcends religious and social divides. People from all walks of life participate, making it a powerful symbol of the nation's secular and inclusive ethos.
*   **A Protest Against Evil:** The original spirit of using culture as a form of protest against oppression and a call for truth and justice remains a core theme.

In **2016**, **UNESCO** inscribed Mangal Shobhajatra on its **Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity**. It was recognized as a cultural heritage that "symbolises the pride of the people of Bangladesh in their living heritage as well as their strength and courage to fight against sinister forces, and their vindication of truth and justice."

#### **(f) Vision 2041**

**Answer:**

**Vision 2041** is the Government of Bangladesh's long-term perspective plan aimed at transforming Bangladesh into a prosperous, developed, and high-income country by the year 2041, which marks the 70th anniversary of its independence. It is the successor to the "Vision 2021" plan, which focused on achieving middle-income status.

The core objectives of Vision 2041 are comprehensive and ambitious, centering on two major goals:
1.  **Becoming a Developed Country:** The primary economic goal is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2031 and achieve the status of a high-income country with a **per capita income of over USD 12,696** by 2041. This involves achieving an average GDP growth rate of over 9% per annum.
2.  **Building a "Sonar Bangla" (Golden Bengal):** Beyond economic indicators, the vision aims to build a prosperous and inclusive society based on the ideals of the Liberation War. This includes:
    *   **Good Governance:** Ensuring transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.
    *   **Sustainable Development:** Focusing on urbanization, green growth, and climate change resilience.
    *   **Human Capital Development:** Investing in education, health, and skills to create a knowledge-based society ready for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
    *   **Infrastructure and Connectivity:** Implementing mega-projects in energy, transport, and digital infrastructure to support rapid economic growth.

The government is implementing this vision through a series of five-year plans, with the **8th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025)** being the first to be aligned with the goals of Vision 2041. It represents the nation's roadmap for its next phase of development.
Of course. Here are the elaborated, data-rich answers for the remaining questions from the "Bangladesh Affairs" paper.

### **Question 03**

#### **(c) Describe the lifestyle of the Santal or Garo ethnic groups.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**

The **Santal** people are one of the largest and most prominent indigenous communities in Bangladesh, primarily residing in the northern districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, and Bogura. Their lifestyle is a rich tapestry of unique social structures, cultural practices, and economic activities.

**1. Social Structure and Governance:**
Santal society is traditionally patriarchal and organized into clans or *paris*. Their social life is governed by a strong sense of community and a traditional administrative system led by a village headman, known as the **Majhi**. The Majhi, assisted by a council of elders, presides over social disputes, religious ceremonies, and community decisions. This system ensures social cohesion and the preservation of their customs.

**2. Economy and Livelihood:**
The primary livelihood of the Santals is **agriculture**. They are known for their skill and deep knowledge of farming, traditionally practicing subsistence agriculture with rice as the main crop. Many Santals work as agricultural laborers on others' lands. Besides farming, they engage in fishing, hunting, and collecting forest resources. In recent times, due to land alienation and economic pressures, many have migrated to urban areas to work in various informal sectors.

**3. Religion and Festivals:**
The traditional Santal religion is animistic, centered on the worship of spirits and deities known as **Bongas**. Their supreme deity is *Thakur Jiu* or *Sin Bonga* (the Sun God). Their religious life is deeply intertwined with nature and the agricultural cycle.

Their most important festivals are:
*   **Sohrai:** A harvest festival celebrated after the rice harvest, involving feasting, dancing, and music.
*   **Baha Porob:** The flower festival, celebrated in spring to welcome the new season, where they worship nature and use Sal flowers in their rituals.
*   **Erok Sim:** A festival held before sowing seeds to seek blessings for a good crop.

**4. Culture and Arts:**
The Santals have a vibrant cultural heritage.
*   **Music and Dance:** Music and dance are integral to their social and religious life. They use traditional instruments like the *tumdak* (a drum), *tirião* (a flute), and *banam* (a stringed instrument). Their group dances, performed by men and women together during festivals, are energetic and rhythmic.
*   **Attire:** Traditionally, Santal women wear a two-piece sari called a *panchi parhat*, while men wear a loincloth or *dhoti*.
*   **Cuisine:** Their staple food is rice, supplemented by vegetables, fish, and occasionally meat. A traditional rice beer, known as **Hariya**, is an important part of their social and festive gatherings.

The Santal lifestyle, though facing challenges from modernization and economic marginalization, remains a distinctive and resilient part of Bangladesh's diverse cultural landscape.

### **Question 04**

#### **(a) What is meant by an archaeological artifact?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

An **archaeological artifact** (or artefact) is any object that was made, modified, or used by humans and is of archaeological interest. These objects are recovered through archaeological excavation or survey and serve as primary evidence for understanding the past. They provide direct, tangible links to the human activities, technologies, beliefs, and social structures of past civilizations.

The scope of archaeological artifacts is vast and includes:
*   **Tools:** Stone tools (like hand axes), metal weapons (swords, arrowheads), and agricultural implements.
*   **Pottery:** Ceramic vessels, pots, and shards, which are crucial for dating sites and understanding trade, cuisine, and artistic practices.
*   **Structures:** Remains of buildings, walls, temples, and tombs.
*   **Ornaments and Art:** Jewelry, beads, statues, figurines, and rock carvings that shed light on aesthetics, social status, and religious beliefs.
*   **Coins and Inscriptions:** Coins help date archaeological layers and indicate economic activity, while inscriptions on stone or metal provide invaluable historical and linguistic information.
*   **Ecofacts:** While not made by humans, organic and environmental remains found in archaeological contexts, such as seeds, animal bones, and pollen, are also studied to reconstruct past environments and diets.

An artifact's significance is determined by its **context**—its precise location in the ground, its association with other artifacts, and its relationship to the surrounding soil layers. This context allows archaeologists to interpret the artifact's age, function, and cultural meaning, thereby reconstructing the human story of a particular time and place.

#### **(b) Introduce Wari-Bateshwar.** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

**Wari-Bateshwar** is one of the most significant archaeological sites in Bangladesh, revealing the existence of a fortified urban center, or *janapada*, that dates back to the **Iron Age**, around 450 BCE. Located in two adjacent villages in the Belabo Upazila of Narsingdi district, the site represents one of the earliest known cities in the country's history.

**Discovery and Excavation:**
The site was first brought to light by a local schoolteacher, **Hanif Pathan**, and later systematically excavated by his son, archaeologist **Sufi Mostafizur Rahman**, from the year 2000 onwards.

**Key Discoveries and Significance:**
1.  **Ancient Urban Center:** Excavations have unearthed the remains of a fortified city with a moat and earthen ramparts, indicating a well-planned urban settlement. It is believed to be the ancient trading emporium known as "Sounagora" mentioned by the Greek geographer Ptolemy.
2.  **Evidence of Trade:** A vast number of artifacts suggest that Wari-Bateshwar was a major trade and commercial center with connections to Southeast Asia and the Roman world. Key finds include:
    *   **Punch-marked coins**, the earliest coin type in the Indian subcontinent.
    *   **Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW)**, a type of luxury pottery.
    *   Semi-precious stone beads, pendants, and iron artifacts.
3.  **Early Industry:** The discovery of slag, furnaces, and raw materials indicates the presence of iron-smelting and bead-manufacturing industries within the settlement.
4.  **Rewriting History:** The discovery of Wari-Bateshwar has fundamentally challenged previous historical narratives by pushing back the timeline of urbanization and organized state-level society in this region by several centuries, confirming that a sophisticated urban culture existed in Bangladesh long before the Mauryan period.

Wari-Bateshwar stands as a testament to the ancient and rich heritage of Bangladesh, providing crucial evidence of its early urban life, technological advancement, and long-standing participation in regional and trans-oceanic trade networks.

### **Question 05**

#### **(a) What is the 'Blue Economy'?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

The **Blue Economy** refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of the ocean ecosystem. It is a concept that moves beyond viewing the ocean simply as a means of extraction and instead promotes an integrated, sustainable, and knowledge-based approach to managing marine resources.

The core principles of the Blue Economy are:
1.  **Sustainability:** Ensuring that the exploitation of marine resources does not deplete them or harm the marine environment, so that future generations can also benefit.
2.  **Economic Growth and Diversification:** Utilizing the ocean to create new industries and job opportunities, diversifying the national economy away from over-reliance on land-based resources.
3.  **Inclusivity:** Ensuring that the benefits of the blue economy, particularly for coastal communities, are shared equitably.

The scope of the Blue Economy is vast and includes both traditional and emerging sectors:
*   **Traditional Sectors:** Fisheries, shipping and maritime transport, and coastal tourism.
*   **Emerging Sectors:** Aquaculture, marine biotechnology, deep-sea mining (for minerals and hydrocarbons), renewable energy (offshore wind, wave, and tidal energy), and marine and coastal protection services.

For a country like Bangladesh with a vast maritime area, the Blue Economy represents a new frontier for development, offering immense potential to contribute to its national GDP, ensure food security, and build a more resilient and sustainable economy.

### **Question 08**

#### **(a) What is meant by 'Demographic Dividend'?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

The **Demographic Dividend** refers to the potential for accelerated economic growth that can result from a shift in a country's population age structure, primarily when the share of the working-age population (typically 15 to 64 years old) is larger than the non-working-age share of the population (children under 15 and adults over 64).

This demographic shift occurs when fertility and mortality rates decline, creating a "bulge" of young people who enter the workforce. This period offers a limited window of opportunity for rapid economic growth due to several factors:
1.  **Increased Labor Supply:** A larger working-age population means more people are available to contribute to economic production.
2.  **Higher Savings Rate:** With fewer dependents (children and elderly) to support, households can save more. This increase in national savings can fuel investment in infrastructure, technology, and industry.
3.  **Increased Human Capital:** Lower fertility rates allow parents and the state to invest more in the health and education of each child, leading to a more skilled and productive workforce.
4.  **Increased Demand:** A growing workforce with rising incomes boosts domestic demand for goods and services, further stimulating economic growth.

However, the demographic dividend is not automatic. To realize this potential, a country must implement supportive policies, including investing in quality education and skills training, ensuring public health, creating sufficient employment opportunities, and promoting good governance. If these policies are not in place, the demographic dividend can turn into a "demographic disaster," with mass unemployment and social unrest.

### **Question 09**

#### **(a) What is meant by intellectual property?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

**Intellectual Property (IP)** refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. It is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect.

Unlike physical property (like land or a car), intellectual property is intangible. The rights associated with IP are protected by law, which grants the creator or owner exclusive rights to use, profit from, and control their creation for a certain period of time. The main purpose of IP law is to encourage innovation and creativity by ensuring that creators can reap the benefits of their work.

The main types of intellectual property are:

1.  **Patents:** A patent grants an inventor exclusive rights to an invention (a product or a process that provides a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem) for a limited period, typically 20 years.
2.  **Copyright:** This protects original works of authorship, such as literary works (books, articles), artistic works (music, paintings, films), and computer software. Copyright gives the owner the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their work.
3.  **Trademarks:** A trademark is a sign, symbol, word, or phrase capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises. It helps consumers identify the source of a product (e.g., the Nike "swoosh").
4.  **Trade Secrets:** These are confidential business information that provides a company with a competitive edge, such as formulas (like the recipe for Coca-Cola), practices, or designs. They are protected by non-disclosure rather than registration.
5.  **Geographical Indications (GI):** A GI is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin (e.g., Jamdani Saree from Bangladesh, Champagne from France).

Intellectual property is a critical asset in the modern knowledge-based economy, driving innovation, economic growth, and cultural development.
