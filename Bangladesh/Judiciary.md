### **Question: What are the main recommendations of the Judiciary Reform Commission as outlined in its executive summary report?**

**Answer:**

The Judiciary Reform Commission, in its January 2025 report, has put forward a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at a multi-dimensional reform of the entire judicial ecosystem of Bangladesh. The proposals address deep-seated issues concerning the appointment and accountability of judges, court structure, operational independence, and overall efficiency to establish a truly independent, transparent, and effective justice system. The main recommendations can be summarized under the following key themes:

**1. Ensuring Judicial Independence and Accountability:**
The Commission's foremost priority is to secure the independence of the judiciary from executive influence. Key recommendations include:
*   **Supreme Court Appointments:** Establishing a 9-member **"Supreme Court Judicial Appointment Commission,"** headed by the Chief Justice, to transparently select and recommend candidates for appointment as judges. The President would be bound to appoint the senior-most judge of the Appellate Division as the Chief Justice.
*   **Independent Supreme Court Secretariat:** Amending Article 116 of the Constitution to create a **separate and independent secretariat for the Supreme Court**. This would transfer full control over the posting, promotion, and discipline of subordinate court judges from the executive to the Supreme Court.
*   **Strengthening the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC):** Expanding the SJC's power to not only investigate allegations against judges upon a presidential reference but also to **initiate investigations suo motu** (on its own motion) and publish a code of conduct for judges.

**2. Decentralization of Courts and Justice System:**
To reduce case backlogs and make justice more accessible, the Commission recommends a significant decentralization of the court system:
*   **Permanent High Court Benches:** Amending Article 100 of the Constitution to establish **permanent benches of the High Court Division in every divisional headquarters**. This would bring High Court services closer to the people, though the plenary jurisdiction of the High Court would remain intact to preserve the unitary character of the state.
*   **Courts at the Upazila Level:** Establishing courts of **Senior Assistant Judges and Judicial Magistrates at the Upazila level** to reduce the caseload on district courts and make formal justice accessible at the grassroots.

**3. Structural Reforms for Efficiency and Professionalism:**
To enhance the professionalism and efficiency of the justice delivery system, the report proposes:
*   **A Permanent "Attorney Service":** Creating a permanent, pensionable **"Attorney Service"** to handle all civil and criminal cases on behalf of the state. This service would have a proper structure for recruitment, promotion, and discipline, separating state lawyers from political influence.
*   **A Separate Criminal Investigation Service:** Establishing an **independent criminal investigation service**, completely separate from the police force, with its own institutional framework to ensure impartial and professional investigation of crimes.
*   **Financial Autonomy for the Judiciary:** Ensuring the financial independence of the judiciary by creating a committee headed by the Supreme Court to determine its own budget. The salaries of judges and judicial staff are to be charged upon the **Consolidated Fund**, making them non-votable in Parliament.

**4. Modernization and Use of Technology:**
The Commission strongly advocates for the modernization of the entire judicial process through technology. This includes amending relevant laws to facilitate the **"E-Judiciary" project**, introducing e-filing for civil cases, promoting e-payments for all court fees, and conducting judicial proceedings like witness testimonies and remand hearings via online video conferencing.

**5. Tackling Case Backlogs and Corruption:**
To address the critical issues of case backlogs and corruption, the recommendations include:
*   **Contractual Appointment of Retired Judges:** Appointing honest and efficient retired district judges on a contractual basis to clear the backlog of civil and criminal appeals.
*   **Mandatory Asset Declaration:** Requiring all judges and court staff to submit asset declarations every three years, to be published on the respective court websites for public scrutiny.
*   **Grievance Redress System:** Establishing formal grievance redress mechanisms, including complaint boxes and dedicated email addresses, for the public to file corruption allegations against judges, court staff, and lawyers.

In conclusion, the Judiciary Reform Commission's report presents a holistic and ambitious roadmap for reform. Its proposals aim to create a structurally independent, geographically accessible, professionally managed, and technologically advanced judicial system that is accountable to the people and capable of delivering timely and impartial justice.
