Based on the provided question paper (Question 1), here are concise discussions for each term, suitable for 5-mark answers:

<center><h2>Short Note</h2></center>

(a) Digital Bangladesh
Digital Bangladesh is a transformative vision launched by the Government of Bangladesh aiming to leverage information and communication technology (ICT) for socio-economic development by 2021. Its core objectives include establishing a digital government for transparent service delivery (e.g., online portals, e-filing), building nationwide ICT infrastructure (high-speed internet, digital centers), empowering citizens through digital literacy, and fostering a knowledge-based economy. Key initiatives like the "a2i Programme" have digitized essential services (land records, education, healthcare), significantly improving accessibility and reducing corruption. While progress is evident in mobile penetration and IT exports, challenges like the digital divide and cybersecurity remain.

**(b) Income Tax**
Income Tax is a direct tax levied by the Government of Bangladesh on the annual income earned by individuals and entities (companies, firms) within the country, governed primarily by the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984. It is a crucial source of government revenue, funding public services and development projects. Tax rates are progressive for individuals (higher income = higher tax rate) and flat/corporate for businesses. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) administers collection, promoting e-filing for efficiency. Challenges include a narrow tax base, tax evasion, and complexities in the tax structure, hindering optimal revenue generation despite efforts to improve compliance.

**(c) Dhaka Elevated Expressway**
The Dhaka Elevated Expressway is a major infrastructure project aimed at alleviating Dhaka's chronic traffic congestion. This 19.73 km tolled expressway runs from the airport area (Kawla) to Kutubkhali Point (Dhaka-Chattogram Highway), primarily elevated above existing roads. Phase 1 (Airport to Farmgate) opened in September 2023. It drastically reduces travel time across the city, improves connectivity to key areas (airport, business districts, port), boosts economic activity, and reduces vehicle emissions by minimizing idling. Its completion marks a significant step in modernizing Dhaka's transport network.

**(d) Women Empowerment**
Women Empowerment refers to the process of enhancing women's capacity to make life choices, exercise their rights, access resources, and control their own lives. In Bangladesh, it involves ensuring equal opportunities in education, healthcare, economic participation (microcredit, entrepreneurship), political representation (reserved seats), and legal protection against violence and discrimination. Government policies, NGO initiatives (like BRAC), and constitutional guarantees drive progress. Empowerment leads to poverty reduction, improved family health/education, and overall economic growth. However, challenges like gender-based violence, wage gaps, and underrepresentation in leadership persist.

**(e) Geographical Indication (GI)**
Geographical Indication (GI) is an intellectual property right identifying a product as originating from a specific geographical location, where its quality, reputation, or characteristics are essentially attributable to that origin. It protects unique local products from imitation and helps producers command premium prices. In Bangladesh, products like Jamdani Saree, Hilsa Fish (from Padma, Meghna, Jamuna rivers), and Khirsapat Mango have received GI tags. This boosts rural economies, preserves cultural heritage, promotes exports, and ensures product authenticity for consumers. The Department of Patents, Designs and Trademarks (DPDT) administers GI registration.

Here is a comprehensive, 20-mark answer for **Question 3: Constitutional Supremacy, Key Principles, and Analysis of Amendments** to the Constitution of Bangladesh:

---

### **Question 3: Constitutional Supremacy and Amendments**  
**A. Concept of Constitutional Supremacy**  
Constitutional supremacy means the **Constitution is the highest legal authority** in a state. All laws, executive actions, and judicial decisions must conform to it. Key principles:  
1. **Grundnorm**: The Constitution is the foundation of all legal validity (as per Kelsen’s theory).  
2. **Judicial Review**: Courts can invalidate laws violating the Constitution (e.g., Article 7(2) of Bangladesh Constitution).  
3. **Limitation on Sovereignty**: Even Parliament cannot amend the Constitution’s "basic structure" (established in *Anwar Hossain Chowdhury v. Bangladesh*, 1989).  

**B. Key Principles of Bangladesh’s Constitution**  
1. **Four Fundamental Pillars**:  
   - **Nationalism** (বাঙালি জাতীয়তাবাদ)  
   - **Socialism** (সমাজতন্ত্র)  
   - **Democracy** (গণতন্ত্র)  
   - **Secularism** (ধর্মনিরপেক্ষতা)  
2. **Fundamental Rights** (Part III): Equality, freedom of speech, religion.  
3. **Directive Principles** (Part II): State obligations for social justice, healthcare, education.  

**C. Amendments (17 Total): Key Changes & Significance**  

|**Amendment**|Year|Key Changes|Significance/Controversy|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1st**|1973|Allowed prosecution of war criminals; validated post-1971 laws.|Established transitional justice.|
|**4th**|1975|Introduced **one-party BAKSAL system**; curtailed fundamental rights.|Abolished multi-party democracy; nullified after 1975 coup.|
|**5th**|1979|Legitimized martial law decrees (1975–1979); indemnified Ziaur Rahman’s actions.|Controversial for validating extra-constitutional regimes.|
|**7th**|1986|Legalized Ershad’s martial law (1982–1986).|SC later declared it void (_Siddique Ahmed v. Bangladesh_).|
|**8th**|1988|Made **Islam the state religion** (Article 2A).|Diluted secularism; sparked minority rights debates.|
|**12th**|1991|Introduced **non-party caretaker government (NCG)** for elections.|Restored electoral fairness; annulled in 2011 (15th Amendment).|
|**13th**|1996|Formalized NCG system after 1996 protests.|Addressed "election engineering" concerns.|
|**15th**|2011|Abolished NCG; restored secularism and 1972 preamble.|Sparked opposition protests; upheld by SC (_Abdul Mannan Khan v. Bangladesh_).|
|**16th**|2014|Allowed suspension of MPs for corruption convictions.|Aimed at moral accountability; criticized for political misuse.|
|**17th**|2018|Enabled incumbent PM to head election-time government.|
**D. Major Controversies & Landmark Judgments**  
1. **Basic Structure Doctrine**:  
   - SC ruling (1989) barred amendments altering core features (democracy, secularism, fundamental rights).  
2. **5th & 7th Amendments**:  
   - Declared **void** in 2010 (*Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd. v. Bangladesh*), restoring 1972 Constitution.  
3. **12th & 13th Amendments**:  
   - NCG system invalidated (2011) due to conflict with parliamentary democracy.  

### **Conclusion**  
Bangladesh’s Constitution embodies **popular sovereignty** but reflects **political turbulence** through its 17 amendments. While early changes (4th, 5th, 7th) undermined its foundations, later corrections (15th) restored core principles. The judiciary’s role in upholding the "basic structure" (e.g., annulling martial law-era amendments) remains vital to preserving constitutional supremacy. Ongoing challenges include balancing religious identity (Article 2A) with secularism and ensuring electoral integrity without NCG.

---

### **Question 5: Social Injustice in Bangladesh**  
**A. Definition of Social Injustice**  
Social injustice refers to **systemic discrimination, inequality, and marginalization** in access to resources, rights, and opportunities based on identity (e.g., class, gender, ethnicity) or socioeconomic status. It manifests as violations of human dignity, unequal distribution of wealth/power, and exclusion from decision-making.  

**B. Manifestations in Bangladesh**  
1. **Economic Inequality**:  
   - Top 10% holds **41% of national wealth** (World Bank, 2023); bottom 20% shares only 8.6%.  
   - **Gini coefficient**: 0.499 (high inequality trend).  
2. **Gender Disparity**:  
   - Female labor force participation: **38%** (vs. 84% male); wage gap: 28% (ILO).  
   - Child marriage rate: **51%** (UNICEF).  
3. **Ethnic & Religious Minorities**:  
   - Indigenous groups (Chakma, Marma) face land dispossession in CHT; Hindu minorities experience property grabbing via Vested Property Act.  
4. **Caste-Based Discrimination**:  
   - Dalits excluded from jobs/education; manual scavenging persists.  
5. **Spatial Inequality**:  
   - Rural poverty (25.1%) vs. urban slums (55% lack sanitation).  

**C. Causes of Social Injustice**  

|**Structural Causes**|**Socio-Political Causes**|
|---|---|
|**Colonial Legacy**: Unequal land tenure systems.|**Weak Governance**: Corruption, poor rule of law.|
|**Neoliberal Policies**: Privatization → job insecurity.|**Patronage Networks**: Elite capture of state resources.|
|**Climate Vulnerability**: 10% of land loss by 2050 → displacement.|**Identity Politics**: Majoritarian exclusion of minorities.|
|**Digital Divide**: 49% lack internet access → education gaps.|**Legal Failures**: Slow justice delivery (3.8M case backlog).|

**D. Impacts of Social Injustice**  
1. **Economic**:  
   - Lost GDP: 30% due to gender inequality (World Bank).  
2. **Human Development**:  
   - Stunting: 28% of children (poor nutrition access).  
3. **Conflict & Instability**:  
   - Ethnic tensions in CHT; radicalization in marginalized communities.  
4. **Intergenerational Poverty**:  
   - 45% of children from poor households remain poor (intergenerational trap).  

**E. Remedial Measures**  
**1. Policy Interventions:**  
   - **Social Safety Nets**: Expand allowances (old age, widow, disability) to cover 15M vulnerable people.  
   - **Progressive Taxation**: Enforce wealth tax to fund education/healthcare.  
**2. Legal Reforms:**  
   - Strengthen **Human Rights Commission**; implement CHT Peace Accord.  
   - Enforce **Anti-Discrimination Laws** (e.g., Caste-based Discrimination Elimination Act).  
**3. Empowerment Initiatives:**  
   - **Gender Equality**: Quotas in local governance (33% female UP members); STEM scholarships for girls.  
   - **Land Reforms**: Digitize records to prevent minority land grabs.  
**4. Inclusive Development:**

   - **Digital Inclusion**: National broadband access for remote areas.  
**5. Civil Society & Awareness:**  
   - Media campaigns against child marriage; community-led human rights monitoring.  


### **Conclusion**  
Social injustice in Bangladesh stems from **entrenched structural inequities** and **governance deficits**, perpetuating cycles of poverty and exclusion. While targeted policies (social safety nets, gender quotas) show promise, sustainable solutions require **systemic reforms**: progressive taxation, land justice, and inclusive digitalization. Addressing these issues is critical for achieving SDGs (e.g., Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities) and ensuring "Shonar Bangla" (Golden Bengal) benefits all citizens equitably.  

**Key Data Points for Depth (20 Marks):**  
- **Rohingya Crisis**: 1.2M refugees strain resources → heightened local inequalities.  
- **RMG Sector**: 4M workers (80% women) earn $95/month → exploitative labor conditions.  
- **Education Gap**: Rural secondary enrollment: 65% (boys) vs. 72% (girls); dropout rate: 40% for poor students.  
- **Landlessness**: 12.5M rural families landless → fuels urban slum growth.  

This answer integrates constitutional mandates (Articles 27-28: Equality), contemporary challenges, and evidence-based solutions aligned with the question’s requirements.

### **Question 6: Agricultural Land Conversion for Non-Agricultural Use in Bangladesh: Process, Crisis, and Solutions**  
**(20 Marks)**  


#### **A. Introduction**  
Bangladesh, with only **0.05 hectares of arable land per capita**, faces a severe crisis as fertile agricultural land is rapidly converted for non-agricultural use (urbanization, industry, infrastructure). This threatens food security, livelihoods, and ecological balance.  


#### **B. Process of Agricultural Land Conversion**  
1. **Drivers of Conversion**:  
   - **Urbanization**: Dhaka, Chattogram expand by **2.5% annually**, swallowing peri-urban farmland (e.g., Gazipur, Savar).  
   - **Industrial Growth**: Export Processing Zones (EPZs), factories (e.g., RMG, textiles) built on fertile deltaic soil.  
   - **Infrastructure Projects**: Roads (e.g., Dhaka-Mawa Expressway), housing projects, and special economic zones (e.g., Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Shilpa Nagar).  
   - **Speculative Land Markets**: Investors buy cheap farmland for future commercial/residential use.  

2. **Legal-Mechanistic Process**:  
   - **Land Zoning Loopholes**: Weak enforcement of the **Agricultural Land Protection Act, 2010** allows rezoning.  
   - **Informal Conversion**: Local authorities (e.g., Union Parishads) permit non-agricultural use via bribes.  
   - **Fragmented Land Records**: Digitally incomplete (only **67%** digitized), enabling illegal sales.  


#### **C. Crisis Analysis**  
| **Domain**        | **Impact**                                                                           | **Quantitative Evidence**                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Food Security** | Rice production loss: **1.5M tons/year** by 2030 (FAO).                              | Arable land shrunk from **9.44M ha (2000)** to **8.6M ha (2023)**.    |
| **Economic**      | Rising food imports (cost: **$8B/year**); displacement of 15% small farmers.         | Agriculture’s GDP share fell from **30% (1990)** to **11.5% (2024)**. |
| **Environmental** | Waterlogging, biodiversity loss; groundwater depletion from concrete cover.          | Dhaka’s green space: **<5%** (WHO recommends 15%).                    |
| **Social**        | Rural-urban migration → slum growth (60% Dhaka slum dwellers are displaced farmers). | 500,000 farmers lose livelihoods annually.                            |


#### **D. Solutions to Resolve the Crisis**  
1. **Policy and Legal Reforms**:  
   - **Strict Land Zoning**: Implement **National Land Use Policy 2001** with GIS mapping; designate "Prime Agricultural Zones" (PAZs) with conversion bans.  
   - **Revised Compensation**: Offer farmers equity shares in industrial projects displacing them.  

2. **Institutional Measures**:  
   - **Digitize Land Records**: Complete **e-mutation** under the **Digital Land Management System** to prevent illegal sales.  
   - **Inter-Ministerial Oversight**: Task force with MoA, MoEF, and MoHA to monitor land use violations.  

3. **Sustainable Alternatives**:  
   - **Vertical Urbanization**: Promote high-rises over horizontal sprawl; reclaim wetlands/brownfields for industry.  
   - **Cluster Industries**: Develop non-arable coastal belts (e.g., Matarbari) for factories.  

4. **Farmer-Centric Initiatives**:  
   - **Incentives for Conservation**: Tax breaks for organic farming; subsidies for multi-cropping to raise land value.  
   - **Skill Transition**: Train farmers for agro-processing or renewable energy sectors.  

5. **Public Awareness**:  
   - **Community Land Banks**: Collective farming cooperatives to resist speculative sales.  
   - **Media Campaigns**: Highlight soil fertility as "non-renewable capital."  


#### **E. Conclusion**  
Unchecked conversion of agricultural land jeopardizes Bangladesh’s food sovereignty and ecological resilience. An integrated approach—combining **legal rigor** (PAZs), **technology** (GIS mapping), and **inclusive rehabilitation**—is vital to balance development with sustainability. Protecting farmland is not anti-progress but a safeguard for **"Shonar Bangla"** where industry and agriculture coexist.  


**Key Data for Depth (20 Marks)**:  
- **Land Loss Rate**: 69,000 ha/year converted (BBS).  
- **Food Gap**: By 2040, rice demand will exceed supply by **5M tons** (IFPRI).  
- **Success Model**: **Vietnam** reduced farmland loss via decentralized land-use planning.  
- **Constitutional Mandate**: Article 18A obligates state protection of natural resources.  

This answer meets the 20-mark requirement through structured analysis, empirical evidence, and actionable solutions aligned with national priorities.

### **Question 7: Disaster Management in Bangladesh: Concept and Government Initiatives**  
**(20 Marks)**  


#### **A. Concept of Disaster Management**  
**Disaster management** refers to the systematic process of **preparing for, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating** natural or man-made disasters to minimize human, economic, and environmental losses. It operates through a cyclical framework:  
1. **Preparedness**: Early warning systems, drills, stockpiling.  
2. **Response**: Emergency rescue, relief, evacuation.  
3. **Recovery**: Rehabilitation, infrastructure rebuilding.  
4. **Mitigation**: Long-term risk reduction (e.g., embankments, afforestation).  

Bangladesh’s vulnerability stems from its **deltaic geography**, with 70% of land flood-prone and 30% coastal areas exposed to cyclones. Climate change intensifies risks (e.g., sea-level rise, erratic monsoons).  


#### **B. Government Initiatives for Disaster Management**  
**1. Policy and Institutional Frameworks:**  
   - **National Plan for Disaster Management (NPDM) 2021–2025**: Aligns with Sendai Framework; focuses on risk-informed development.  
   - **Disaster Management Act (2012)**: Legal basis for coordination; establishes committees from national to local levels.  
   - **Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR)**: Leads implementation; coordinates with CPP, BMD, and IWM.  

**2. Early Warning and Preparedness:**  
   - **Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP)**: World’s largest volunteer network (76,000 volunteers); reduced cyclone deaths by 100x (1970 vs. 2023).  
   - **Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC)**: 7-day flood forecasts via 86 monitoring stations; SMS alerts to 5M+ people.  
   - **Multi-Hazard Early Warning System**: Integrates cyclone, tsunami, and landslide alerts (e.g., "In Danger" app).  

**3. Infrastructure for Mitigation:**  
   - **Cyclone Shelters**: 5,500+ shelters (capacity: 5M people); solar-powered with gender-segregated facilities.  
   - **Embankments and Polders**: 12,000 km of coastal embankments (e.g., Coastal Embankment Improvement Project).  
   - **Mangrove Afforestation**: "Green Belt" project planted 120,000 hectares of mangroves (Sundarbans buffer).  

**4. Response and Recovery Mechanisms:**  
   - **Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs)**: 64 district-level EOCs for real-time coordination.  
   - **Cash-for-Work Programs**: Post-disaster livelihood support (e.g., 500,000 employed after 2022 floods).  
   - **Climate Resilient Housing**: 150,000 disaster-proof homes built (e.g., "Cluster Villages" in coastal zones).  

**5. Community-Based Adaptation:**  
   - **Urban Resilience Project**: Dhaka flood management (water pumps, drainage).  
   - **School Safety Programs**: 10,000+ schools conduct disaster drills annually.  
   - **Agriculture Adaptation**: Saline-tolerant rice (BRRI dhan97); floating farms in haor basins.  


#### **C. Impact and Challenges**  
**Successes**:  
- Cyclone fatalities dropped from **500,000 (1970)** to **<50 (2023)**.  
- **90%** of coastal residents now evacuate during warnings (World Bank).  
- Ranked **1st in climate adaptation** (Global Climate Risk Index 2021).  

**Challenges**:  
1. **Urban Flooding**: Dhaka’s drainage blocked by waste; 40% waterlogged in monsoons.  
2. **Funding Gaps**: Only 0.7% of GDP allocated for climate adaptation (needs: 2–3%).  
3. **Riverbank Erosion**: Displaces 200,000+ yearly; limited resettlement plans.  
4. **Cross-Border Water Stress**: Unilateral dam construction (e.g., Tipaimukh) exacerbates floods/droughts.  


#### **D. Future Directions**  
1. **Nature-Based Solutions**: Expand mangroves and wetland restoration.  
2. **Tech Integration**: AI-based flood modeling; drone-assisted damage assessment.  
3. **Regional Cooperation**: Joint water management with India/Nepal under BIMSTEC.  
4. **Private Sector Engagement**: Insurance schemes for climate-vulnerable farmers.  

### **Conclusion**  
Bangladesh has pioneered globally lauded disaster management through **community mobilization**, **infrastructure resilience**, and **policy innovation**. However, escalating climate threats demand increased investment, transboundary cooperation, and inclusive adaptation strategies to secure its future. As Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stated: *"We view disasters not as unavoidable fate, but as challenges to overcome."*

### **Question 9: Teesta Water Sharing Dispute: Causes and Government Initiatives**  
**(20 Marks)**  


#### **A. Why Teesta Water Sharing Remains Stalled**  
The **Teesta River** (length: 414 km; 90% flows from India to Bangladesh) is critical for northern Bangladesh’s agriculture and ecology. Despite decades of negotiation, **no permanent treaty** exists due to:  

1. **Political Complexities in India**:  
   - **West Bengal’s Opposition**: CM Mamata Banerije fears water scarcity for her state’s farmers (dries to 500 cusecs in lean season).  
   - **Inter-State Disputes**: Upstream Sikkim’s hydro-projects reduce flow; federal-state jurisdictional conflicts.  

2. **Asymmetric Power Dynamics**:  
   - India controls 55% of the catchment area; Bangladesh depends on 80% of the river’s flow for irrigation.  

3. **Technical Disagreements**:  
   - **Data Gap**: Dispute over lean-season flow volume (Bangladesh claims 1,200 cusecs; India cites <500 cusecs).  
   - **Climate Change**: Erratic rainfall reduces predictability.  

4. **Broader Geopolitics**:  
   - India links Teesta to broader cooperation (transit, security); Bangladesh seeks standalone resolution.  


#### **B. Initiatives by Bangladesh and India**  
**1. Diplomatic Efforts:**  
   - **2011 Draft Agreement**: Proposed 50:50 water share in lean season; **vetoed by Mamata** last-minute.  
   - **Joint Rivers Commission (JRC)**: 38 meetings since 1972; no breakthrough.  
   - **High-Level Visits**:  
     - PM Hasina raised Teesta in *every* meeting with Indian PMs (Singh, Modi).  
     - Modi’s 2015 Dhaka visit pledged "early resolution" (unfulfilled).  

**2. Technical Measures:**  
   - **Teesta Barrage Project (Bangladesh)**: $1B project to irrigate 750,000 ha now runs at 20% capacity due to water scarcity.  
   - **India’s Counter-Proposals**:  
     - **Rainwater Harvesting**: Artificial reservoirs in Sikkim (limited impact).  
     - **River Interlinking**: Feasibility studies to divert Brahmaputra water (decades-long process).  

**3. Sub-National Diplomacy:**  
   - Bangladesh engaged West Bengal directly (e.g., Hasina-Mamata meetings in 2015, 2019).  
   - **Track-II Dialogues**: Civil society groups (e.g., Observer Research Foundation) propose "flexible sharing formulas."  

**4. Legal/International Avenues:**  
   - Bangladesh mulled approaching the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** but prioritizes bilateralism.  
   - Ratified **UN Watercourses Convention (2014)** to pressure India.  


#### **C. Impact of the Deadlock**  
| **Bangladesh**                                                                      | **India**                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - **Agricultural Loss**: 1M+ farmers affected; rice yield down 30% in Rangpur.      | - **Diplomatic Trust Deficit**: Harms "Neighborhood First" policy.                                     |
| - **Ecological Damage**: 60 rivers dried up in Teesta basin; groundwater depletion. | - **Chinese Inroads**: Bangladesh signed $1B Teesta management deal with China (2016), alarming India. |
| - **Humanitarian Crisis**: 100,000+ climate migrants from drought-hit areas.        | - **Security Risks**: Radicalization in impoverished border zones.                                     |
