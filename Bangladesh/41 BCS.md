Of course. Here are the elaborated, data-rich answers for this "Bangladesh Affairs" paper, designed to meet the expectations of a high-scoring response.

***

### **Question 01**

#### **(a) Discuss the influence of the following events behind the organization of the Liberation War of Bangladesh:** (Marks: 5+5+5=15)

**(1) The Language Movement of 1952:**
The 1952 Language Movement was the foundational event that sowed the seeds of Bengali nationalism and, ultimately, the Liberation War. Its influence was profound and multifaceted:
*   **Birth of Cultural Nationalism:** The movement was the first successful mass resistance against the cultural and political domination of the West Pakistani ruling elite. By demanding recognition for the Bengali language, it established that the identity of the people of East Bengal was rooted in their language and culture, not just in their shared religion of Islam. This cultural nationalism became the ideological bedrock of the independence movement.
*   **Creation of a Political Consciousness:** The sacrifice of the language martyrs on **February 21, 1952**, created a powerful political consciousness and a sense of collective identity among the Bengalis. It demonstrated that the central government was willing to use brutal force to suppress their legitimate demands, fostering deep-seated mistrust and alienation.
*   **Inspiration for Future Movements:** The success of the Language Movement served as a powerful inspiration for all subsequent political movements for autonomy and rights, from the 1954 election to the 1969 mass uprising. It proved that organized popular struggle could challenge the authority of the state.

~~**(2) The historic 7th March Speech:**~~
~~Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's speech on March 7, 1971, was the direct political and psychological catalyst for the Liberation War. Its influence was transformative:~~
*   ~~**De Facto Declaration of Independence:** While carefully avoiding a unilateral declaration that could have invited immediate military crackdown, Bangabandhu's concluding cry, *"Ebarer shongram amader muktir shongram, ebarer shongram shadhinotar shongram"* ("The struggle this time is for our emancipation, the struggle this time is for our independence"), was universally understood as the call for independence.~~
*   ~~**Providing a Clear Roadmap:** The speech provided a clear set of directives for a civil disobedience and non-cooperation movement, effectively establishing a parallel civilian government and paralyzing the Pakistani administration in East Pakistan.~~
*   ~~**Uniting the Entire Nation:** It galvanized the entire Bengali nation—students, peasants, workers, and government officials—under a single leader and a single goal. The speech provided the moral authority and psychological preparation needed for the armed struggle that was to follow, turning a political movement into a national liberation struggle.~~

**(3) The Mass Uprising of '69:**
The 1969 Mass Uprising was a watershed moment that demonstrated the political maturity and unwavering resolve of the Bengali people, directly paving the way for the events leading to the war.
*   **Fall of a Dictator:** The mass movement, fueled by the student's 11-Point Programme and outrage over the Agartala Conspiracy Case, successfully forced the resignation of the military dictator, Field Marshal Ayub Khan. This was a massive victory for people's power and proved that the authoritarian regime was not invincible.
*   **Establishment of Bangabandhu's Leadership:** The unconditional release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from jail as a result of the uprising and the subsequent bestowing of the title **"Bangabandhu"** (Friend of Bengal) upon him solidified his position as the undisputed leader of the Bengali nation.
*   **Paving the Way for the 1970 Election:** The uprising forced the new military regime under General Yahya Khan to concede to the demand for a general election based on universal adult franchise. This election, in which the Awami League won a landslide victory, became the legal and democratic basis for Bangladesh's claim to independence.

#### **(b) By which organization was the historic 7th March speech recognized as 'World Documentary Heritage'? When and why?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
The historic 7th March speech was recognized as 'World Documentary Heritage' by the **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)**.

*   **When:** The recognition was granted on **October 30, 2017**.
*   **Why:** UNESCO included the speech in its **Memory of the World International Register**. The Register is a compendium of documents, manuscripts, oral traditions, and audio-visual materials that are deemed to have outstanding universal value and represent a part of the common heritage of humanity.

The speech was recognized because:
1.  It is a unique historical document that effectively declared the independence of a nation and inspired its people to fight for freedom.
2.  It serves as a powerful testament to the struggle against oppression and for democratic rights and self-determination.
3.  UNESCO acknowledged it as a masterpiece of political oratory that had a transformative impact on the course of history for the Bengali people. Its inclusion ensures its preservation and accessibility for future generations worldwide as a symbol of the universal human aspiration for freedom.

### **Question 02**

#### **(a) What do you understand by the Representation of the People Order (RPO)?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
The **Representation of the People Order, 1972 (RPO)** is the primary legal framework that governs the conduct of elections for the **Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament)** in Bangladesh. It is an ordinance promulgated by the President that provides the detailed laws, rules, and procedures for every stage of the electoral process.

The RPO is essentially the procedural rulebook for the Election Commission and all stakeholders in an election. Key aspects covered by the RPO include:
*   **Conduct of Elections:** Procedures for the announcement of the election schedule, submission of nomination papers, scrutiny of nominations, and withdrawal of candidature.
*   **Voter and Candidate Eligibility:** Defines the qualifications and disqualifications for voters and candidates.
*   **Electoral Code of Conduct:** Lays down the rules of conduct for political parties, candidates, and their supporters during the campaign period, including limits on election expenditure.
*   **Polling Procedures:** Details the process of voting, counting of ballots, and consolidation and declaration of results.
*   **Electoral Offenses and Penalties:** Defines various electoral offenses such as rigging, voter intimidation, and violations of the code of conduct, and prescribes the corresponding legal penalties.

The RPO empowers the Election Commission to take necessary measures to ensure a free and fair election. It is frequently amended to adapt to changing circumstances and to strengthen the electoral process.

### **Question 03**

#### **(a) What do you understand by civil society?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
**Civil society** refers to the "third sector" of society, distinct from the state (government) and the market (business). It is the sphere of collective, voluntary action where citizens come together to articulate their interests, express their values, and pursue common goals.

Civil society is composed of a wide range of non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations that have a presence in public life. Its key characteristics are:
*   **Autonomy:** It operates independently of direct state control.
*   **Voluntary Participation:** It is based on the voluntary association of citizens.
*   **Focus on Public Good:** Its activities are generally aimed at advancing public interests and common welfare, rather than private profit.

In Bangladesh, civil society includes:
*   **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs):** Like BRAC, Grameen Bank.
*   **Professional Associations:** Such as the Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA), and lawyers' associations.
*   **Advocacy Groups and Human Rights Organizations:** Like Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), and Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK).
*   **Academic and Research Institutions (Think Tanks):** Such as the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD).
*   **Media:** Independent newspapers and television channels.

The role of civil society is to act as a watchdog over the government, advocate for policy changes, protect human rights, provide services where the state is lacking, and create a space for public debate and democratic participation.

#### **(c) Discuss the role of NGOs in the empowerment of women in Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) have played a transformative and pioneering role in the empowerment of women in Bangladesh, particularly since the country's independence. Their interventions have targeted the economic, social, and political spheres, fundamentally altering the status of women, especially in rural areas.

**1. Economic Empowerment through Microfinance:**
This is the most significant contribution. NGOs like the **Grameen Bank** (a Nobel Peace Prize laureate) and **BRAC** pioneered the concept of microcredit, providing small, collateral-free loans almost exclusively to poor rural women.
*   **Impact:** This has enabled millions of women to start small businesses (e.g., poultry farming, handicrafts, small trade), generating their own income. This economic independence has given them a greater say in household decision-making, improved their self-esteem, and reduced their dependence on male family members.

**2. Health and Family Planning:**
NGOs have been instrumental in delivering essential health services to women's doorsteps.
*   **BRAC's *Shasthya Shebikas*** (community health workers) have been a cornerstone of rural healthcare, providing maternal and child health services, family planning counseling, and health education. This has contributed significantly to reducing maternal and infant mortality rates and increasing contraceptive prevalence.

**3. Education and Skills Development:**
*   **Non-Formal Primary Education:** BRAC's non-formal primary education model created access to education for millions of children, especially girls, who had dropped out or never enrolled in the formal school system.
*   **Adult Literacy and Skills Training:** NGOs run numerous programs for adult female literacy and provide vocational training in areas like sewing, handicrafts, and modern agriculture, enhancing women's employability.

**4. Social Awareness and Legal Aid:**
NGOs have played a crucial role in raising awareness about women's rights and combating social evils like child marriage, dowry, and domestic violence. Organizations like **Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK)** and **Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST)** provide free legal aid to women who are victims of violence and injustice, helping them access the legal system.

**5. Political Empowerment:**
By organizing women into social groups and federations at the grassroots level, NGOs have fostered leadership skills and political consciousness. These platforms have encouraged women to participate in local government elections and advocate for their rights within their communities.

In summary, NGOs have been a powerful catalyst for women's empowerment in Bangladesh by creating economic opportunities, improving access to health and education, and raising social and political consciousness.

### **Question 04**

#### **(a) What is a 'constitution'? When was the constitution of Bangladesh first enacted? Briefly discuss its fundamental principles.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
A **constitution** is the supreme law of a sovereign state. It is a set of fundamental principles, established precedents, and legal rules according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed. It outlines the structure of the government, defines the powers and duties of its various organs (the executive, legislature, and judiciary), and guarantees the fundamental rights of its citizens.

**Enactment of the Bangladesh Constitution:**
*   The Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh was formed with the members elected in the 1970 national and provincial elections.
*   A 34-member constitution drafting committee, chaired by Dr. Kamal Hossain, was formed on April 11, 1972.
*   The draft constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on **November 4, 1972** (known as Constitution Day).
*   The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh was first officially enacted and came into effect on **December 16, 1972**, the first anniversary of the nation's victory in the Liberation War.

**Fundamental Principles:**
The Constitution of Bangladesh is founded on four fundamental principles of state policy, as laid down in **Article 8**:
1.  **Nationalism:** Based on the linguistic and cultural unity of the Bengali people forged during the Liberation War.
2.  **Socialism:** Aiming to establish an egalitarian society free from exploitation.
3.  **Democracy:** Guaranteeing a representative form of government with fundamental human rights for all citizens.
4.  **Secularism:** Ensuring the separation of religion from the state and prohibiting discrimination on religious grounds.

These principles are intended to guide the state in its governance and legislation, reflecting the core ideals of the Liberation War.

### **Question 05**

#### **(a) What is the fundamental basis of Bangladesh's foreign policy? Discuss.** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
The fundamental basis of Bangladesh's foreign policy is succinctly captured in the **Article 25** of the Constitution.

**Discussion:**
This guiding principle has been translated into a pragmatic, non-aligned, and peace-centric foreign policy. It means that Bangladesh seeks to maintain friendly and cooperative relations with all countries of the world, irrespective of their political systems or ideologies, based on mutual respect for sovereignty, equality, and non-interference in internal affairs.

Key aspects of this policy include:
*   **Peaceful Settlement of Disputes:** Bangladesh strongly advocates for resolving international conflicts through peaceful dialogue and diplomacy rather than confrontation.
*   **Commitment to International Law and the UN Charter:** As a small state, Bangladesh relies on a rules-based international order and is a staunch supporter of the United Nations. Its significant contribution to UN Peacekeeping operations is a direct manifestation of this commitment.
*   **Economic Diplomacy:** The policy is heavily geared towards achieving national economic interests, focusing on promoting trade, attracting investment, and securing development partnerships.
*   **Strategic Balancing:** While maintaining a deep and special relationship with its neighbor India, Bangladesh also cultivates strong economic ties with other major powers like China, Japan, the USA, and Russia, carefully balancing its relationships to maximize its national interest without becoming entangled in great power rivalries.

This policy has allowed Bangladesh to maintain a positive image on the world stage and to effectively navigate the complexities of regional and global politics.

#### **(c) What role can the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh play in repatriating the Rohingya sheltered in Bangladesh back to Myanmar?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) plays the central and most critical role in the efforts to repatriate the Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar. Its role is multifaceted, involving diplomacy at bilateral, regional, and international levels.

1.  **Bilateral Diplomacy with Myanmar:** MoFA's primary role is to engage in direct negotiations with the Myanmar authorities. This involves:
    *   Holding regular meetings of the **Joint Working Group (JWG)** established under the 2017 bilateral repatriation agreement.
    *   Pressuring Myanmar to create a safe, voluntary, and dignified environment for return in Rakhine State by halting violence and ensuring security.
    *   Negotiating the modalities of the verification process and the logistics of the return.

2.  **Regional Diplomacy:** MoFA must work to keep the Rohingya issue on the agenda of regional forums like **ASEAN** and **BIMSTEC**. It needs to persuade influential ASEAN members (like Indonesia and Malaysia) to exert collective pressure on Myanmar, an ASEAN member state, to comply with its obligations.

3.  **Multilateral Diplomacy:** MoFA spearheads Bangladesh's efforts at the global level. This includes:
    *   Raising the issue consistently at the **United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)** and the **UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC)** to keep international pressure on Myanmar.
    *   Coordinating with key international partners like the **USA, UK, EU, and Canada** to maintain and strengthen sanctions against the Myanmar military junta.
    *   Providing support and information for the ongoing accountability processes at the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** and the **International Criminal Court (ICC)**, as justice is a key component of a sustainable solution.

4.  **Public Diplomacy:** The Ministry is responsible for managing the international narrative, highlighting Bangladesh's immense humanitarian burden and countering any misinformation from Myanmar, ensuring the world remains focused on a just resolution.

In essence, MoFA acts as the diplomatic engine driving all efforts to find a peaceful and sustainable solution to the crisis through persistent negotiation and the mobilization of international pressure.

### **Question 06**

#### **(b) How can the vast population of Bangladesh be transformed into human resources and utilized for the economic development of the country? Describe with examples.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
Transforming Bangladesh's vast population from a liability into a "demographic dividend"—a skilled human resource—is the single most critical task for its economic development. This can be achieved through a concerted strategy focused on education, health, and skills development.

**1. Investing in Quality Education and Vocational Training:**
The primary step is to move beyond mere literacy and focus on quality education that is aligned with the demands of the modern economy.
*   **Strategy:** Overhaul the education curriculum to emphasize science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Massively expand **Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)** programs to create a skilled workforce.
*   **Example:** Germany's dual-education system, where students split their time between classroom instruction and on-the-job training in a company, can be a model. Bangladesh can partner with its industries, especially the RMG and light engineering sectors, to create similar apprenticeship programs, ensuring graduates have job-ready skills.

**2. Focusing on Health and Nutrition:**
A healthy population is a productive population.
*   **Strategy:** Ensure universal access to quality healthcare, particularly for mothers and children. Focus on improving nutrition to reduce stunting and create a physically and cognitively strong future workforce.
*   **Example:** The success of Bangladesh's own community health clinics and NGO health worker programs can be scaled up and integrated with digital health solutions (telemedicine) to provide healthcare services to the last mile.

**3. Developing a Globally Competitive Workforce for the 4th Industrial Revolution:**
The global economy is being reshaped by automation and AI. Bangladesh must prepare its youth for these changes.
*   **Strategy:** Establish specialized training institutes and incorporate modules on AI, data science, IoT, and blockchain technology into university curricula. Provide incentives for the IT industry to grow and absorb this skilled talent.
*   **Example:** India's success in becoming a global IT outsourcing hub demonstrates the potential. Bangladesh can target niche markets in the global IT and BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) industry, leveraging its large, young, and cost-competitive workforce.

**4. Facilitating Safe and Skilled Migration:**
Remittances are a lifeline for Bangladesh's economy.
*   **Strategy:** Instead of sending unskilled labor, the government should focus on providing pre-departure training and certification for specific skills that are in high demand in destination countries (e.g., certified caregivers for Japan, skilled construction workers for the Middle East).
*   **Example:** The Philippines has a highly organized system for training and deploying its overseas workers, particularly in the nursing and maritime sectors. Bangladesh can adopt a similar model to increase the value of its remittances and protect its migrant workers.

By implementing these strategies, Bangladesh can transform its large population into its greatest asset, driving the innovation, productivity, and growth needed to achieve its goal of becoming a developed nation.

Of course. I will provide the detailed, data-rich answers for the final remaining question from the "Bangladesh Affairs" paper (`./17.jpg`).

### **Question 07**

#### **(a) "In this world, all that is great, all that is eternally benevolent, half of it was created by women, the other half by men." — In your own words, express your opinion on how much this quote by National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam aligns with the current social context of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**

This powerful quote from our National Poet, Kazi Nazrul Islam, written decades ago, is a profound assertion of gender equality. It posits that human civilization and all its achievements are the result of the equal and complementary contributions of both men and women. In my opinion, this statement aligns significantly with the aspirations of modern Bangladesh, yet the reality on the ground shows a mixture of remarkable progress and persistent challenges.

**Alignment and Progress:**
The spirit of Nazrul's words is increasingly reflected in the visible progress of women in Bangladesh's social context today.
1.  **Economic Contribution:** Women are the backbone of our nation's most vital economic sector—the **Ready-Made Garments (RMG) industry**, where they constitute over 80% of the workforce. Their labor has single-handedly driven Bangladesh's export growth and placed it on the global economic map. In agriculture, from sowing to post-harvest processing, women's contribution is indispensable, though often unrecognized. The success of microfinance has also turned millions of rural women into small-scale entrepreneurs.
2.  **Political Leadership:** Bangladesh stands as a unique example globally, having been led by female Prime Ministers for over three decades. Women are also making their mark as Speakers of Parliament, ministers, and in local government, breaking traditional barriers of political leadership.
3.  **Education and Health:** Bangladesh has achieved gender parity in primary and secondary school enrollment, a remarkable success story. Female community health workers have been the driving force behind the country's impressive achievements in reducing maternal and child mortality.

**Gaps and Challenges:**
Despite this progress, the "other half" is still struggling to achieve the full equality that Nazrul envisioned.
1.  **Unpaid Care Work:** The immense contribution of women in the domestic sphere—child-rearing, cooking, and household management—remains largely invisible, unvalued, and not accounted for in our national GDP. This "unpaid care work" is the foundation upon which the formal economy stands, yet it is not recognized as part of the "great creation."
2.  **Gender-Based Violence:** The prevalence of domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other forms of gender-based violence remains a dark stain on our social fabric. It undermines women's safety, dignity, and their ability to participate fully in society.
3.  **Wage Gaps and Leadership Barriers:** While women form the workforce's base, they are significantly underrepresented in higher-level management and leadership positions across all sectors. A persistent gender wage gap also means they are often paid less than men for work of equal value.
4.  **Social Norms and Patriarchy:** Deep-seated patriarchal attitudes and social norms continue to restrict women's freedom, mobility, and life choices, from child marriage to control over their own bodies and assets.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, Kazi Nazrul Islam's visionary statement is more relevant than ever as a guiding ideal for Bangladesh. We have made incredible strides in bringing women into the public sphere and recognizing their contributions, particularly in the economic and political arenas. However, the full realization of this equal partnership is still hindered by the shadows of patriarchal norms, violence, and the invisibility of women's domestic labor. The current social context shows that while we are on the right path, the journey to make Nazrul's poetic truth a complete social reality is ongoing.
