### **Answer to Question 1**

**Question:**
a) Discuss the influence of the following events on the occurrence of the Bangladesh Liberation War:
    1) The 1952 Language Movement
    2) The historic 7th March Speech
    3) The 1969 Mass Uprising
b) Which organization recognized the historic 7th March Speech as 'World Documentary Heritage'? When and why?

**Introduction**

The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 was not a sudden outburst but the culmination of a 24-year struggle against Pakistani oppression. This struggle was shaped by a series of landmark events that progressively built the Bengali nation's resolve for independence. The seeds of nationalism sown during the Language Movement grew through the defiance of the 1969 Mass Uprising and blossomed into a clear call for freedom in the historic 7th March Speech, setting the final stage for the war.

#### **a) Influence of Key Events on the Liberation War**

**1) The 1952 Language Movement:**
The Language Movement was the first major assertion of Bengali cultural and political identity. When the Pakistani government tried to impose Urdu as the sole state language, ignoring the Bengali-speaking majority, it sparked widespread protests. The martyrdom of students on February 21, 1952, was a turning point.
*   **Influence:** It established that Bengalis would not accept cultural subjugation. It created a deep sense of linguistic nationalism and a separate identity from West Pakistan, laying the ideological foundation for all subsequent movements. It was the first time Bengalis shed blood for their rights, turning a cultural demand into a political one.

**2) The historic 7th March Speech (1971):**
Delivered by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at a critical moment when the Pakistani junta refused to hand over power, this speech was the ultimate clarion call for independence.
*   **Influence:** It provided a clear and direct guideline for the upcoming struggle. Bangabandhu's declaration, "The struggle this time is for our emancipation, the struggle this time is for our independence," effectively united the entire nation and prepared them mentally and emotionally for an armed conflict. It served as the central source of inspiration for the freedom fighters and the general populace throughout the nine-month war.

**3) The 1969 Mass Uprising:**
This popular uprising was a spontaneous mass movement against the autocratic rule of General Ayub Khan and the filing of the Agartala Conspiracy Case against Sheikh Mujib.
*   **Influence:** It demonstrated the unshakeable popular support for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the demand for Bengali autonomy (as outlined in the Six-Point Program). The movement's success in forcing the regime to withdraw the case and release Sheikh Mujib proved that the collective will of the people was stronger than the state's repressive machinery. It shattered the myth of Pakistani military invincibility and solidified Sheikh Mujib's position as the undisputed leader of the Bengali nation, paving the way for the 1970 election victory.

#### ~~b) Recognition of the 7th March Speech~~

*   ~~**Organization:** The **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)** recognized the 7th March Speech as part of the 'World Documentary Heritage'.~~
*   ~~**When:** The recognition was granted on **October 30, 2017**, when the speech was included in the **Memory of the World International Register**.~~
*   ~~**Why:** UNESCO recognized the speech for its immense historical significance and its powerful message of freedom and human rights. It was acknowledged as a unique documentary heritage that had a profound impact on the course of history, mobilizing an entire nation to fight for its independence. The register aims to preserve documentary heritage of universal value, and the 7th March Speech was deemed a masterpiece of political oratory that transcends national boundaries in its appeal for justice and self-determination.~~

~~**Conclusion**~~

~~From the cultural awakening of 1952 to the political defiance of 1969, and finally to the decisive call to arms in 1971, these events were crucial milestones on the road to Bangladesh's independence. The international recognition of the 7th March Speech by UNESCO serves as a global testament to the justness of the Bengali cause and the profound power of words to shape history.~~

### **Answer to Question 2**

**Question:**
a) What is meant by the Representation of the People Order (RPO)? (5 marks)
b) Discuss the role of the Bangladesh Election Commission in conducting the National Parliament election. (10 marks)
c) What role can election observers play in ensuring a fair election? (5 marks)

**Introduction**

Free, fair, and credible elections are the cornerstone of a functional democracy. In Bangladesh, the legal framework for conducting elections is primarily governed by the Representation of the People Order (RPO), 1972. The Bangladesh Election Commission, an independent constitutional body, is entrusted with the monumental task of implementing this law to ensure that the people can elect their representatives freely. The presence of election observers further enhances the transparency and credibility of this vital democratic exercise.

#### **a) What is Meant by the Representation of the People Order (RPO)?**

The Representation of the People Order, 1972 (commonly known as the RPO) is the principal electoral law of Bangladesh. It is a comprehensive legal document that provides the detailed rules, regulations, and procedures for conducting elections to the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament).

The RPO covers all aspects of the electoral process, including:
*   The powers and functions of the Election Commission.
*   The process of voter registration and preparation of electoral rolls.
*   The qualifications and disqualifications of candidates.
*   The procedures for submitting nomination papers, campaigning, polling, counting votes, and declaring results.
*   The definition of electoral offenses and the corresponding penalties.

In essence, the RPO is the "rulebook" that guides the Election Commission, political parties, candidates, and all other stakeholders in the conduct of parliamentary elections.

#### **b) Role of the Bangladesh Election Commission in Conducting National Elections**

The role of the Bangladesh Election Commission (EC) is central to the entire electoral process. Its constitutional mandate is to exercise "superintendence, direction, and control" over the election. Its key roles include:

1.  **Overall Management:** The EC plans, organizes, and manages the entire election from start to finish. This includes announcing the election schedule, which sets the dates for nomination, scrutiny, withdrawal, and polling.
2.  **Deployment of Officials:** The EC appoints thousands of government officials as Returning Officers, Assistant Returning Officers, Presiding Officers, and Polling Officers to conduct the election at the field level. All these officials work under the direct command of the EC during the election period.
3.  **Voter List and Constituency Management:** The EC is responsible for preparing and updating the electoral rolls (voter lists) and delimiting the boundaries of the 300 parliamentary constituencies.
4.  **Candidate Management:** It scrutinizes the nomination papers submitted by candidates to ensure they meet all legal qualifications and allocates electoral symbols to the validly nominated candidates.
5.  **Enforcing the Code of Conduct:** The EC formulates and strictly enforces an electoral Code of Conduct to ensure a level playing field for all parties and candidates. This includes monitoring election expenses, preventing the use of force or intimidation, and taking action against violators.
6.  **Polling and Result Declaration:** The EC manages all polling day logistics, including the distribution of ballot papers and election materials. After the votes are counted, it compiles the results and officially declares the winners through a gazette notification.

#### **c) Role of Election Observers in Ensuring a Fair Election**

Election observers, both domestic and international, play a crucial role as independent third-party witnesses to the electoral process. Their presence helps ensure fairness and transparency in several ways:

1.  **Deterrence of Malpractice:** The very presence of neutral observers at polling stations can deter electoral fraud, voter intimidation, and other irregularities by officials or party activists.
2.  **Increasing Transparency:** Observers monitor all stages of the electionâ€”from voter registration to campaigning, polling, and vote counting. Their systematic observation makes the entire process more open and transparent.
3.  **Building Public Confidence:** When credible observer groups report that an election was conducted in a free and fair manner, it enhances the confidence of the public and political parties in the legitimacy of the results.
4.  **Providing Independent Assessment:** Observers provide an impartial assessment of the quality of the election. Their reports can identify strengths and weaknesses in the electoral process and offer valuable recommendations for future reforms.
5.  **Enhancing International Legitimacy:** Positive reports from international observer missions can enhance the international community's acceptance and legitimacy of the newly elected government.

**Conclusion**

The RPO provides the legal foundation, the Election Commission acts as the institutional manager, and election observers serve as the independent verifiers of the electoral process. The effective functioning of all three components is essential for ensuring that parliamentary elections in Bangladesh are free, fair, and credible, thereby strengthening the roots of its democracy.

### **Answer to Question 3**

**Question:**
a) What is meant by civil society? (5 marks)
b) Discuss the difference between NGOs and civil society. (5 marks)
c) Discuss the role of NGOs in women's empowerment in Bangladesh. (10 marks)

**Introduction**

In any modern democratic state, the space between the individual citizen and the government is occupied by a vibrant sphere of associations and organizations known as civil society. This sector plays a crucial role in representing public interest, advocating for rights, and holding power to account. Within this broad sphere, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) have emerged as key institutional actors, particularly in Bangladesh, where they have made significant contributions to socio-economic development, with women's empowerment being one of their most impactful areas of work.

#### **a) What is Meant by Civil Society?**

Civil society refers to the "third sector" of society, distinct from the state (government) and the market (business). It is the collective name for the wide range of non-profit, voluntary organizations, associations, and citizen groups that operate in the public sphere.

Key characteristics of civil society organizations (CSOs) are:
*   They are independent of the state.
*   They are formed by citizens on a voluntary basis.
*   Their primary aim is not to make a profit but to advance shared goals, values, and interests.

Civil society includes a diverse array of entities, such as professional associations, community groups, religious organizations, trade unions, advocacy groups, and NGOs. They play a vital role in a democracy by articulating citizens' concerns, advocating for policy changes, promoting human rights, and providing social services.

#### **b) Difference Between NGOs and Civil Society**

While NGOs are a part of civil society, there is a distinction between the two concepts.

| Basis of Difference | Civil Society | Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | Civil society is a very broad and all-encompassing concept. It includes both formal, registered organizations and informal, unorganized citizen movements and groups. | An NGO is a specific, formal, and structured type of organization within the broader civil society. |
| **Structure** | It can be both organized (like a trade union) and unorganized (like a spontaneous protest movement). | NGOs are typically formally registered, with a clear organizational structure, staff, and governance (e.g., an executive board). |
| **Function** | Its functions are diverse, ranging from advocacy and awareness-building to cultural activities and community mobilization. | NGOs usually have specific, project-based functions, often focused on service delivery (e.g., providing healthcare, microcredit) or rights-based advocacy. |
| **Relationship** | **All NGOs are part of civil society**, but not all of civil society consists of NGOs. | NGOs are a key institutional component and a professionalized arm of civil society. |

In short, civil society is the wider arena, while NGOs are one of the most visible and organized actors operating within that arena.

#### **c) Role of NGOs in Women's Empowerment in Bangladesh**

NGOs have been at the forefront of the women's empowerment movement in Bangladesh, playing a transformative role in improving the status of women.

1.  **Economic Empowerment through Microcredit:** This is the most well-known contribution. NGOs like **Grameen Bank, BRAC, and ASA** pioneered the microcredit model, providing small loans to poor rural women without requiring collateral. This has enabled millions of women to start small businesses, generate their own income, and achieve a degree of financial independence. This economic autonomy has, in turn, enhanced their decision-making power within the family.
2.  **Health and Family Planning:** NGOs have been instrumental in delivering essential health services to women in remote areas. They have raised awareness about maternal health, nutrition, and family planning, contributing significantly to the reduction of maternal and child mortality rates.
3.  **Education for Girls:** NGOs like BRAC run massive non-formal primary education programs, which have been particularly successful in bringing millions of out-of-school girls into the education system, thereby increasing female literacy rates.
4.  **Raising Social Awareness and Combating Violence:** NGOs have led nationwide campaigns against social evils like dowry, child marriage, and domestic violence. They provide legal aid, counseling, and shelter to female victims of violence and work to change patriarchal social norms.
5.  **Leadership Development and Political Participation:** Through group formation and training, NGOs have helped women develop leadership skills. This has encouraged them to participate in local government (e.g., as members of Union Parishads) and voice their opinions in community affairs.

**Conclusion**

Civil society provides the essential space for citizen action, and NGOs are powerful vehicles within it. In Bangladesh, NGOs have moved beyond their traditional role of service delivery to become catalysts for social change. Their targeted and sustained interventions in microcredit, health, education, and social awareness have been a primary driving force behind the remarkable progress in women's empowerment, fundamentally altering the social and economic landscape for millions of women across the country.

### **Answer to Question 4**

**Question:**
a) What is a 'Constitution'? When was the Constitution of Bangladesh first enacted? Briefly discuss its fundamental principles. (10 marks)
b) Which version of the Constitution of Bangladesh is currently followed? Explain its significance. (10 marks)

**Introduction**

A constitution is the supreme and foundational law of a state, serving as the blueprint for its governance and the protector of its citizens' rights. The Constitution of Bangladesh, born from the ideals of the Liberation War, is a testament to the nation's commitment to democracy, justice, and human dignity. Though it has undergone several amendments, its current form, largely restored to its original spirit, holds immense significance for the country's legal and political identity.

#### **a) The Constitution and its Fundamental Principles**

**What is a Constitution?**
A constitution is a set of fundamental principles and established precedents according to which a state is governed. It defines the structure and powers of the main organs of government (the legislature, executive, and judiciary), establishes the relationship between them, and outlines the fundamental rights and duties of its citizens. As the supreme law of the land, all other laws must conform to it.

**Enactment of Bangladesh's Constitution:**
The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh was drafted by a Constituent Assembly and was formally adopted on **November 4, 1972**. It came into full effect on **December 16, 1972**, on the first anniversary of Victory Day.

**Fundamental Principles (Brief Discussion):**
As stated in Article 8, the four fundamental principles are:
1.  **Nationalism:** Based on the linguistic and cultural unity of the Bengali people, forged during the Liberation War.
2.  **Socialism:** Aimed at establishing an egalitarian society free from exploitation.
3.  **Democracy:** Guaranteeing a government of the people, ensuring human rights and fundamental freedoms.
4.  **Secularism:** Ensuring freedom of religion and eliminating religious discrimination by the state.

#### **b) The Current Version of the Constitution and its Significance**

**Current Version:**
The version of the Constitution currently followed in Bangladesh is the one that exists after the **15th Amendment**, which was passed by the Parliament in 2011. While it is the amended version, it is often referred to as a "restored" version because a primary goal of this amendment was to revert the constitution back to its original 1972 character by removing the undemocratic changes made during the periods of military rule.

**Significance of this Version:**

1.  **Restoration of Original Principles:** The most significant aspect of the current version is the reinstatement of the four original fundamental principles: **Nationalism, Socialism, Democracy, and Secularism**. This restored the secular and progressive spirit of the 1972 Constitution, which had been altered by previous military regimes.
2.  **Strengthening Constitutional Supremacy:** The 15th Amendment inserted **Article 7A**, which makes any unconstitutional takeover of power (such as a military coup) an act of sedition and a capital offense. This was a landmark step to safeguard constitutional continuity and prevent future extra-constitutional interventions, thereby strengthening democratic norms.
3.  **Abolition of the Caretaker Government System:** A highly significant and controversial change was the abolition of the non-partisan caretaker government system for overseeing elections. The current constitution mandates that elections be held under the incumbent government, a change that has profoundly impacted the country's political landscape.
4.  **Incorporation of Historical Documents:** This version gives constitutional sanctity to key historical documents. It incorporates the **Proclamation of Independence** and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's **historic 7th March Speech** as schedules, making them an immutable part of the nation's supreme law.
5.  **Recognition of the Father of the Nation:** It formally recognizes Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation within the constitutional text.

**Conclusion**

The current version of the Constitution of Bangladesh, as shaped by the 15th Amendment, is a document of immense significance. It represents a conscious effort to realign the nation's legal framework with the foundational ideals of the Liberation War. By restoring secularism, entrenching democratic safeguards, and honoring the nation's history, it has fortified the constitution's moral and political authority. However, its changes to the electoral system have also created deep political divisions, highlighting the ongoing and complex nature of constitutional evolution in Bangladesh.

**Question:**
a) What is the basis of Bangladesh's foreign policy? Discuss. (5 marks)
b) Discuss the role of the Bangladesh Army in UN peacekeeping missions. (10 marks)
c) What role can the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh play in sending the Rohingya population in Bangladesh back to Myanmar? (5 marks)

**Introduction**

Bangladesh's foreign policy is a reflection of its history, values, and national interests. Rooted in the spirit of its Liberation War, it seeks to promote peace, cooperation, and sovereign equality on the global stage. This commitment is vividly demonstrated through the Bangladesh Army's exemplary contributions to UN peacekeeping missions. A major contemporary challenge for its diplomacy, however, is orchestrating the safe and dignified repatriation of the Rohingya population, a task that falls heavily on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

#### **a) The Basis of Bangladesh's Foreign Policy**

**Discussion:**
This guiding principle means that Bangladesh seeks to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with all countries of the world, irrespective of their political or social systems. It is a policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence. It dictates that Bangladesh will:
*   Respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.
*   Refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.
*   Seek the peaceful settlement of international disputes.
*   Uphold international law and the principles of the UN Charter.
*   Support oppressed peoples worldwide in their struggle against imperialism and racism.

In practice, this principle translates into a pragmatic foreign policy focused on promoting economic development, ensuring national security, and enhancing the country's image as a responsible and peace-loving nation.

#### **b) Role of the Bangladesh Army in UN Peacekeeping Missions**

The Bangladesh Army, along with other branches of the armed forces and police, has established itself as a leading contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations, earning the title "Blue Helmets." Their role has been exemplary and multifaceted.

1.  **Maintaining Peace and Security:** The primary role is to maintain peace in post-conflict zones. This includes monitoring ceasefires, disarming ex-combatants, protecting civilians, and creating a secure environment for political processes to take hold.
2.  **Humanitarian Assistance:** Bangladeshi peacekeepers are often involved in providing critical humanitarian aid, including distributing food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations affected by conflict.
3.  **Engineering and Reconstruction:** The engineering corps of the Bangladesh Army has played a vital role in post-conflict reconstruction. They are renowned for their work in building and repairing roads, bridges, and airfields, and for their expertise in de-mining operations, which is crucial for making land safe for civilians to return.
4.  **Medical Services:** Army medical teams have established field hospitals and provided essential healthcare services to both UN staff and local populations in mission areas.
5.  **Professionalism and Compassion:** Bangladeshi peacekeepers are highly respected for their professionalism, discipline, and compassionate approach. They often build strong, positive relationships with local communities, which enhances the effectiveness and credibility of the UN mission.

This consistent and high-quality contribution has not only helped maintain global peace but has also significantly elevated Bangladesh's prestige and soft power on the international stage.

#### **c) Role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rohingya Repatriation**

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) is the lead government agency responsible for orchestrating the diplomatic efforts to repatriate the Rohingya population. Its role is central and critical.

1.  **Bilateral Diplomacy:** MoFA's primary role is to engage in continuous bilateral negotiations with Myanmar. This involves holding regular meetings to implement existing agreements (like the 2017 bilateral arrangement on return) and pressuring Myanmar to create a safe, secure, and conducive environment in Rakhine State for the Rohingya to voluntarily return.
2.  **Multilateral Mobilization:** MoFA actively mobilizes support at multilateral forums like the **United Nations (UN), the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the Commonwealth**. It works to keep the Rohingya crisis on the international agenda, sponsors resolutions at the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council, and seeks international pressure on Myanmar.
3.  **Engaging Regional Powers:** The ministry engages with key regional and global powers, including **China, India, Japan, the USA, and the European Union**, urging them to use their influence on Myanmar to expedite the repatriation process.
4.  **Public Diplomacy:** MoFA engages in public diplomacy to counter misinformation and present Bangladesh's humanitarian position to the world, highlighting the immense burden the country is bearing and emphasizing that the only sustainable solution is repatriation.

**Conclusion**

Guided by its founding principle of peaceful coexistence, Bangladesh actively contributes to global peace through its leading role in UN peacekeeping. This positive international image strengthens its diplomatic hand as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs navigates the complex and challenging task of securing the repatriation of the Rohingya. The successful resolution of the Rohingya crisis remains the single most important foreign policy objective for Bangladesh, requiring sustained and skillful diplomacy on all fronts.

### **Answer to Question 6**

**Question:**
a) Explain the role of education, society, and the economy in the overall development of Bangladesh, discussing their interrelationship. (10 marks)
b) How can the vast population of Bangladesh be transformed into human resources and used for the economic development of the country? Describe with examples. (10 marks)

**Introduction**

The overall development of a nation is a complex process driven by the dynamic interplay between its people, its social structures, and its economic activities. In Bangladesh, education, society, and the economy are three deeply interconnected pillars that mutually reinforce one another. Education builds the human capital that drives the economy, a prosperous economy shapes a progressive society, and a stable society provides the foundation for both. The key to accelerating this development cycle lies in transforming the country's large population from a perceived liability into a skilled human resource, a valuable asset for national progress.

#### **a) Interrelationship of Education, Society, and Economy**

Education, society, and the economy are intertwined in a continuous feedback loop.

1.  **Education's Impact on Economy and Society:**
    *   **On the Economy:** Education is the primary driver of economic growth. It produces a skilled and productive workforce (human capital) that can innovate, adopt new technologies, and move the economy up the value chain from agriculture to industry and services. A more educated population leads to higher individual incomes and national GDP.
    *   **On Society:** Education is a powerful tool for social transformation. It promotes progressive values, reduces superstition, improves health and hygiene awareness, lowers fertility rates, and increases social mobility. It empowers citizens to understand their rights and duties, fostering a more democratic and tolerant society.

2.  **Economy's Impact on Education and Society:**
    *   **On Education:** A growing economy generates the financial resources (through taxes and private investment) needed to fund a quality education system. It also creates the demand for skilled labor, which in turn shapes the focus of the education system.
    *   **On Society:** Economic development can lead to significant social changes. It can reduce poverty, improve living standards, and lead to urbanization. However, if not managed equitably, it can also increase income inequality, which can lead to social tensions.

3.  **Society's Impact on Education and Economy:**
    *   **On Education:** A society's values and norms influence its attitude towards education. A society that values education, particularly for girls, will have higher enrollment and literacy rates.
    *   **On the Economy:** A stable, cohesive, and law-abiding society provides a conducive environment for business and investment. Social factors like trust and a strong work ethic are crucial for economic prosperity.

#### **b) Transforming Population into Human Resources**

Bangladesh's large population, particularly its large youth cohort (demographic dividend), can be transformed into a powerful engine for economic development through strategic investment in human capital.

**How to Transform:**

1.  **Invest in Quality and Relevant Education:** The focus must shift from mere literacy to quality education that imparts relevant skills. This involves:
    *   Modernizing school curricula to emphasize science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
    *   Expanding **Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)** to create a large pool of skilled technicians and workers for industries.
2.  **Develop a Healthy Population:** A healthy workforce is a productive one. This requires ensuring access to affordable healthcare, improving nutrition (especially for children and mothers), and ensuring safe water and sanitation.
3.  **Skill Development for Overseas Employment:** Training workers in skills that are in high demand in international labor markets can significantly boost remittance inflows, which is a key driver of the economy. **Example:** Training nurses, construction workers, and IT professionals for specific foreign markets.
4.  **Promoting Entrepreneurship:** Instead of just creating job seekers, the education system and government policies should encourage entrepreneurship. **Example:** Providing access to finance (like startup funds), business incubation support, and training can help young people start their own enterprises, creating jobs for others.
5.  **Empowering Women:** Bringing more women into the formal workforce can effectively double the country's human resource base. **Example:** The success of the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) industry, which employs millions of women, is a powerful testament to how female empowerment directly drives economic development.

**Conclusion**

The relationship between education, society, and the economy is symbiotic; strengthening one pillar invariably strengthens the others. For Bangladesh, the path to sustained development lies in strategically investing in its people. By transforming its vast population into a healthy, educated, and skilled human resource through quality education and targeted skill development, Bangladesh can fully capitalize on its demographic dividend and accelerate its journey towards becoming a prosperous and developed nation.

### **Answer to Question 7**

**Question:** "Whatever great creations in the world, whatever is eternally beneficial, half of it was created by woman, half of it by man."
To what extent does this quote from the national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam align with the current social context of Bangladesh? Express your opinion in your own words. (10 marks)

**Answer:**

**Introduction**

Kazi Nazrul Islamâ€™s powerful and egalitarian lines, penned decades ago, articulate a universal truth: that true progress is built on the equal contribution of both men and women. This quote serves as an ideal against which we can measure the social context of contemporary Bangladesh. While Bangladesh has made remarkable and internationally acclaimed strides in women's empowerment, a critical analysis shows that while the nation is moving towards Nazrul's vision, significant gaps still exist before this ideal becomes a complete reality.

**Alignment with the Current Social Context of Bangladesh**

In my opinion, there is a significant and growing alignment between Nazrul's quote and the reality of Bangladesh, but the alignment is not yet complete.

**Areas of Strong Alignment (Progress Made):**

1.  **Economic Contribution:** The most visible alignment is in the economic sphere. The Ready-Made Garments (RMG) industry, the backbone of Bangladesh's economy, is overwhelmingly powered by millions of women workers. Their labor is not "half" but the majority of the force that earns over 80% of the country's export revenue. In agriculture, women's contribution to post-harvest activities, livestock rearing, and homestead farming is immense, though often undervalued and unpaid.
2.  **Political Empowerment:** Bangladesh has set a unique example in top-level political leadership, having been led by female Prime Ministers for most of the last three decades. There are reserved seats for women in the National Parliament and in all tiers of local government, ensuring their presence in the political decision-making process.
3.  **Education:** The gender gap in primary and secondary education has been successfully closed, with girls' enrollment now surpassing boys' in many cases. This has created a foundation for a future generation of educated and capable women ready to contribute to all sectors.

**Areas of Incomplete Alignment (Challenges Remaining):**

1.  **Unequal Share in Formal Leadership and Economy:** Despite progress, women's participation in the formal labor force is still significantly lower than men's. They are largely absent from top managerial and leadership positions in the corporate world. The gender pay gap persists, and the majority of women's work in the home and in informal sectors remains unrecognized and unvalued in national economic accounts.
2.  **Prevalence of Patriarchal Norms:** Deep-seated patriarchal attitudes continue to create barriers. Women still bear the disproportionate burden of household chores and childcare (the "second shift"), which limits their ability to participate fully in public and economic life. Social evils like child marriage, dowry, and domestic violence, though legally prohibited, are still widespread, reflecting a society that has not yet fully accepted women as equal partners.
3.  **Lack of Safety and Security:** The lack of a safe environment for women in public spaces and workplaces remains a major impediment. Issues of harassment and violence against women are serious concerns that restrict their freedom of movement and limit their potential.

**Conclusion**

Kazi Nazrul Islam's vision of equal partnership is no longer a distant dream for Bangladesh; it is an actively pursued national goal. The country's progress in empowering women economically and politically is undeniable and aligns strongly with the spirit of the quote. However, the journey is incomplete. The "half" created by women is often less visible, less valued, and achieved against greater social odds. To fully realize Nazrul's ideal, Bangladesh must move beyond just creating opportunities and focus on dismantling the structural and social barriers of patriarchy, ensuring that women's contributions are not only present but are also equally recognized, valued, and celebrated in every sphere of life.

### **Answer to Question 8**

**Question:**
a) Express your opinion by analyzing the importance of protecting the forests and forest resources of Bangladesh and the steps taken by the government in this regard. (10 marks)
b) Explain the concept of 'sustainable development' and discuss its importance and ways to survive in the modern world in the context of Bangladesh. (10 marks)

**Introduction**

In a densely populated country like Bangladesh, the protection of natural resources like forests is not a luxury but a critical necessity for ecological balance, climate resilience, and economic well-being. Recognizing this, the government has taken various steps to conserve its forests. This conservation effort is intrinsically linked to the broader global concept of 'sustainable development,' which provides a crucial framework for Bangladesh to navigate the challenges of the modern world, ensuring that today's progress does not come at the expense of future generations.

#### **a) Importance of Protecting Forests and Government Initiatives**

**Importance of Protecting Forests:**
The importance of protecting Bangladesh's forests and forest resources is multifaceted:
1.  **Ecological Balance and Biodiversity:** Forests are vital ecosystems that host a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna. The Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to the Royal Bengal Tiger. Forests are crucial for maintaining the ecological balance.
2.  **Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation:** Forests act as "carbon sinks," absorbing carbon dioxide and mitigating global warming. Mangrove forests like the Sundarbans also act as a natural barrier, protecting the coastal areas from cyclones and tidal surges, which is a critical adaptation strategy for a climate-vulnerable country.
3.  **Economic and Livelihood Support:** Forests provide timber, fuel wood, medicinal plants, and other resources. They support the livelihoods of millions of people who live in and around them.
4.  **Preventing Soil Erosion:** The root systems of trees hold the soil together, preventing erosion, especially in hilly areas, and reducing the risk of landslides.

**Government Initiatives:**
1.  **Legal and Policy Framework:** The government has enacted the Forest Act and a National Forest Policy to regulate the use of forest resources and prevent illegal deforestation.
2.  **Social Forestry Programs:** This is a key initiative where the government partners with local communities to plant trees on fallow and marginal lands. The community members protect the trees and, in return, get a share of the benefits when the trees are harvested. This has been successful in increasing green cover and providing livelihoods.
3.  **Protected Area Management:** The government has declared several forests as National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, and Eco-parks to protect them from encroachment and conserve biodiversity.
4.  **Coastal Afforestation:** A massive afforestation program has been undertaken along the coastal belt to create a "green belt" of mangrove and other salt-tolerant species to protect the coastline from natural disasters.

**My Opinion:**
While the government's initiatives, especially social forestry, are commendable, enforcement of laws against illegal logging and land grabbing remains a significant challenge. Greater community involvement and ensuring that local people have a real stake in forest conservation are crucial for long-term success.

#### **b) Sustainable Development in the Context of Bangladesh**

**Concept of 'Sustainable Development':**
'Sustainable development' is defined as **"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."** This concept rests on three interconnected pillars:
1.  **Economic Sustainability:** Ensuring long-term, stable economic growth.
2.  **Social Sustainability:** Ensuring social equity, justice, and improved quality of life for all.
3.  **Environmental Sustainability:** Protecting the environment and conserving natural resources.

**Importance and Ways to Survive in the Modern World:**
For a climate-vulnerable and resource-constrained country like Bangladesh, adopting the principles of sustainable development is not a choice but a necessity for survival and prosperity.

1.  **Importance:**
    *   **Climate Resilience:** Sustainable practices are essential for building resilience against the impacts of climate change.
    *   **Resource Management:** It ensures that finite natural resources like gas, water, and land are used efficiently and preserved for the future.
    *   **Long-Term Economic Viability:** It promotes a shift away from polluting, resource-intensive industries towards greener, more sustainable economic models, which are more competitive in the long run.

2.  **Ways to Survive (Applying the Concept):**
    *   **Adopting Green Technologies:** Bangladesh needs to promote renewable energy (solar, wind), enforce stricter standards for industrial pollution control (e.g., effluent treatment plants), and move towards a circular economy that minimizes waste.
    *   **Climate-Smart Agriculture:** Implementing agricultural practices that are resilient to climate change, such as cultivating saline-tolerant crop varieties and promoting water-efficient irrigation, is crucial for food security.
    *   **Planned Urbanization:** Managing the rapid growth of cities sustainably by investing in public transport, ensuring green spaces, and proper waste management is vital to avoid turning them into unlivable concrete jungles.
    *   **Investing in Human Capital:** The most sustainable investment is in people. Educating the population about sustainability and developing a skilled workforce can drive the innovation needed for a green economy.

**Conclusion**

The protection of Bangladesh's forests is a critical component of its broader commitment to sustainable development. In the face of immense environmental and economic pressures, the path of sustainability offers the only viable strategy for Bangladesh to continue its remarkable development journey, ensuring a safe, prosperous, and resilient future for all its citizens.

### **Answer to Question 9 (Page 14)**

**Question:**
a) Discuss the difference between a 'pandemic' and an 'epidemic'. (5 marks)
b) Discuss how much the 'COVID-19' pandemic has affected the economy and health sector of Bangladesh. (10 marks)
c) Discuss the role of local government institutions in dealing with the pandemic. (5 marks)

**Introduction**

The COVID-19 outbreak presented an unprecedented global health crisis, quickly escalating from an epidemic to a pandemic that profoundly impacted every nation, including Bangladesh. Understanding the distinction between these terms is crucial to grasping the scale of the threat. In Bangladesh, the pandemic severely tested the resilience of both the economy and the health sector, while highlighting the vital role that local government institutions can play in mounting an effective grassroots response.

#### **a) Difference Between 'Pandemic' and 'Epidemic'**

The key difference between a pandemic and an epidemic lies in the **geographical scale** of the disease outbreak.

*   **Epidemic (à¦®à¦¹à¦¾à¦®à¦¾à¦°à§€):** An epidemic is a situation where a disease spreads rapidly and affects a large number of people **within a specific community, population, or region**. The outbreak is unexpectedly large but is contained within a particular geographical area. For example, a severe cholera outbreak in a single country would be considered an epidemic.

*   **Pandemic (à¦…à¦¤à¦¿à¦®à¦¾à¦°à§€):** A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over **multiple countries or continents**, usually affecting a large number of people worldwide. It is a global disease outbreak. The term refers to the geographic spread of the disease, not necessarily its severity. The 1918 Spanish Flu and the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak are classic examples of pandemics.

In simple terms, an epidemic is regional, while a pandemic is global.

#### **b) Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Bangladesh**

The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe and multifaceted impact on Bangladesh.

**Impact on the Economy:**
1.  **Disruption of Supply Chains:** Nationwide lockdowns and global restrictions severely disrupted both domestic and international supply chains, hindering production and trade.
2.  **Impact on RMG Sector:** The Ready-Made Garments (RMG) sector, the backbone of the economy, faced massive order cancellations from Western buyers, leading to factory closures and job losses in the initial phase.
3.  **Loss of Livelihoods:** Millions of people working in the informal sector (e.g., transport workers, street vendors, day laborers) lost their source of income overnight due to lockdowns, leading to a sharp increase in poverty.
4.  **Decline in Remittances:** In the early stages, remittances from overseas workers declined as many lost their jobs or faced salary cuts in their host countries.
5.  **Growth Slowdown:** While Bangladesh managed to maintain positive GDP growth, the rate of growth slowed down significantly compared to pre-pandemic projections.

**Impact on the Health Sector:**
1.  **Overwhelmed System:** The existing healthcare infrastructure was quickly overwhelmed by the surge of COVID-19 patients. There was a critical shortage of hospital beds, ICUs, ventilators, and oxygen supplies.
2.  **Disruption of Regular Health Services:** The health system's focus on COVID-19 led to the neglect of regular health services, such as routine immunizations, maternal care, and treatment for non-communicable diseases.
3.  **Health Worker Crisis:** Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers faced immense pressure, working long hours with inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and suffering high rates of infection and mortality.

#### **c) Role of Local Government Institutions in Dealing with the Pandemic**

Local government institutions (LGIs) like City Corporations, Pourashavas, and especially Union Parishads played a critical role as the frontline responders in the pandemic.

1.  **Implementing Lockdowns and Quarantine:** LGIs were responsible for implementing government-mandated lockdowns and ensuring that people returning from abroad or infected individuals maintained home quarantine in their respective areas.
2.  **Distribution of Relief:** They were the primary channel for distributing government relief and humanitarian aid (food and cash) to the poor and those who had lost their livelihoods.
3.  **Awareness Campaigns:** Elected representatives and staff of LGIs conducted awareness campaigns at the local level, using mikes and distributing leaflets to inform people about health guidelines like wearing masks, handwashing, and social distancing.
4.  **Coordination of Health Services:** They worked in coordination with local health officials to identify suspected cases, assist in contact tracing, and facilitate the national vaccination campaign by preparing lists of eligible people and managing vaccination centers.

**Conclusion**

The COVID-19 pandemic was a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of global health, posing severe challenges to Bangladesh's economy and revealing the vulnerabilities of its health sector. However, the crisis also highlighted the strength of its grassroots governance, as local government institutions proved to be indispensable in implementing public health measures and delivering essential support to the people during a time of national crisis.

#### **b) Economic Diplomacy**

Economic diplomacy refers to the use of a country's diplomatic resources and activities to advance its national economic interests. It involves using foreign policy tools to increase trade, attract foreign direct investment (FDI), secure development aid, promote exports, and ensure energy security. For a developing country like Bangladesh, economic diplomacy is a key priority. Bangladeshi diplomats and missions abroad are actively engaged in finding new markets for its products (like RMG), negotiating trade agreements, promoting Bangladesh as an attractive investment destination, and managing relationships to ensure the well-being and employment of its large overseas workforce, whose remittances are vital for the economy.

---

#### **c) Road Accidents and Bangladesh**

Road accidents are a severe public health and national crisis in Bangladesh. The country has one of the highest road fatality rates in the world. The primary causes of these accidents are multifaceted and include reckless driving and speeding, unfit vehicles, poor road infrastructure, weak enforcement of traffic laws, and a lack of public awareness. The economic cost is enormous, estimated to be a significant percentage of the GDP due to loss of life, disability, and property damage. The massive student-led **Road Safety Movement in 2018** highlighted the urgency of the issue, prompting the government to pass a new Road Transport Act. However, effective implementation remains a major challenge.

---

#### **d) Maritime Boundary Victory of Bangladesh**

This refers to Bangladesh's historic and peaceful resolution of its maritime boundary disputes with its neighbors, Myanmar and India. In **2012**, the **International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)** delivered a verdict in favor of Bangladesh in its dispute with Myanmar. Subsequently, in **2014**, the **Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)** in The Hague ruled in favor of Bangladesh in its dispute with India. Through these two landmark legal victories, Bangladesh gained sovereign rights over **118,813 square kilometers** of maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal, along with a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone and a significant portion of the continental shelf. This victory opened up vast opportunities for the country to explore and exploit marine resources under its "Blue Economy" initiative.

#### **e) Proper Use of Gas Resources**

Natural gas is the most important indigenous energy resource in Bangladesh, fueling its power plants, industries, and households. The "proper use" of these finite resources involves a strategy that balances current needs with future sustainability. This includes:
1.  **Efficient Exploration:** Accelerating exploration activities, both onshore and offshore, to discover new gas reserves.
2.  **Rational Pricing:** Setting gas prices that reflect its economic value to discourage wasteful consumption.
3.  **Promoting Efficiency:** Encouraging the use of energy-efficient appliances in households and modern, efficient machinery in industries.
4.  **Diversifying Energy Mix:** Reducing over-reliance on gas for power generation by increasing the share of other sources like coal, nuclear, and renewable energy.
Proper use is essential to ensure long-term energy security for Bangladesh's continued economic development.

---

#### **f) Role of Political Parties in Democracy**

Political parties are indispensable actors in a representative democracy. Their primary roles include:
1.  **Aggregating and Articulating Interests:** They bring together diverse public opinions and interests and formulate them into coherent policy programs.
2.  **Contesting Elections:** They select and field candidates for elections, providing voters with a choice of leadership and policies.
3.  **Forming Governments:** The party that wins a majority in an election forms the government and implements its promised policies.
4.  **Acting as a 'Loyal Opposition':** The losing party or parties form the opposition, whose role is to scrutinize the government's actions, hold it accountable, and present an alternative government-in-waiting.
In a healthy democracy, political parties provide the essential link between the people and the government, facilitating political participation and debate.
