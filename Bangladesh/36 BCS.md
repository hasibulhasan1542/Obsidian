Of course. Here are the detailed answers to all parts of Question 1 from the "International Affairs" examination paper, translated and elaborated in English with the requested formal and academic tone.

***

### **1. Discuss briefly the following ten topics:**

*(Note: As requested, answers to all twelve topics are provided below.)*

**(a) What is BRICS?**

**BRICS** is a significant geopolitical and economic grouping comprising five major emerging national economies: **B**razil, **R**ussia, **I**ndia, **C**hina, and **S**outh Africa. The acronym was originally coined as "BRIC" in 2001 by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill to highlight the rising economic potential of these nations. It evolved from an economic concept into a formal intergovernmental forum with the first summit of BRIC leaders in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, transforming the group into BRICS.

The core objective of BRICS is to enhance cooperation among its members and to amplify their collective voice on the global stage. It seeks to challenge the long-standing dominance of Western-led institutions in global governance and finance. The most prominent achievements of the group are the establishment of the **New Development Bank (NDB)**, an alternative to the World Bank, to fund infrastructure and sustainable development projects, and the **Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA)**, a financial safety net designed to protect members against global liquidity pressures, acting as an alternative to the IMF. BRICS represents a significant movement towards a more multipolar world order.

**(b) What is meant by a nation-state?**

A **nation-state** is a specific form of political organization and a foundational concept in international relations. It represents the ideal convergence of a "nation" (a cultural and ethnic entity) with a "state" (a political and legal entity).

*   The **nation** is a community of people who feel a sense of unity and shared identity based on common factors such as language, history, culture, ethnicity, or religion. It is a psycho-cultural bond.
*   The **state** is a sovereign political-legal unit with a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within its borders.

The nation-state, therefore, is an ideal in which the territorial boundaries of the state are coterminous with the demographic boundaries of the nation. In such a state, the vast majority of citizens share a common national identity. This alignment is believed to foster political unity, social cohesion, and stability. While the nation-state is the theoretical norm of the modern international system, a "pure" nation-state is rare in practice. Most countries are multi-national states (like India or Canada), containing multiple national or ethnic groups within their borders.

**(c) What are the characteristics of sovereignty?**

Sovereignty is the quintessential and defining attribute of the modern state. It refers to the supreme and absolute authority of the state within its territory. Its characteristics are typically understood through its two classical dimensions, as well as several other key attributes:

1.  **Internal Sovereignty:** This is the supreme authority of the state *within* its own borders. It means the state is the highest law-making and law-enforcing power, and no other internal group (e.g., a corporation, church, or province) has the authority to challenge its decisions.
2.  **External Sovereignty:** This is the independence of the state from any external authority or control. It signifies that the state is an autonomous entity on the world stage, free to determine its own foreign policy and not subject to the dictates of other states. This underpins the principle of non-intervention in international law.
3.  **Permanence:** Sovereignty is a permanent feature of the state. While governments may change, the sovereignty of the state endures.
4.  **Exclusiveness:** The sovereign state holds a monopoly on power within its territory. There cannot be two co-equal sovereign powers within a single state.
5.  **Indivisibility:** Traditionally, sovereignty is considered indivisible, meaning it cannot be partitioned. However, in modern federal states, power is often shared between central and regional governments, challenging this classical view.
6.  **Absoluteness:** In theory, the power of the sovereign is absolute and unlimited, though in practice, it is constrained by constitutions, international law, and public opinion.

**(d) Write about the anti-terrorism Islamic military coalition.**

The anti-terrorism Islamic military coalition is formally known as the **Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC)**. It was announced in December 2015 by Saudi Arabia and is headquartered in Riyadh. It is a pan-Islamic alliance of countries united in the declared fight against terrorism.

The stated purpose of the IMCTC is to coordinate and support military efforts to combat terrorism and to serve as a platform for security cooperation. Its activities are focused on four key domains:
1.  **Ideology:** Countering extremist narratives and promoting a message of moderation.
2.  **Communications:** Combating terrorist propaganda and misinformation campaigns.
3.  **Counter-Terrorist Financing:** Collaborating to disrupt and cut off funding channels for terrorist organizations.
4.  **Military:** Coordinating military efforts, sharing intelligence, and providing security assistance to member states in their counter-terrorism operations.

Geopolitically, the formation of the IMCTC is viewed by many analysts in the context of the regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Notably, Iran, Iraq, and Syria are not members of the coalition, leading to critiques that it is a predominantly Sunni-centric bloc aimed at consolidating Saudi leadership in the Islamic world as much as it is about fighting terrorism in general.

**(e) Define Transit and Transshipment.**

Transit and Transshipment are two related but distinct logistical terms crucial to international trade, particularly for landlocked countries and global supply chains.

*   **Transit** refers to the passage of goods or people through the territory of one country en route from a second country to a third country. During transit, the goods do not clear customs or enter the commerce of the country they are passing through. They are merely using the country as a land bridge or corridor. For example, when goods from landlocked Nepal are transported across India to reach an Indian seaport for export, their movement across Indian territory is "transit."

*   **Transshipment** is the logistical process of unloading goods from one mode of transport and loading them onto another at a hub or terminal. This often occurs at a port or airport within a transit country. In the example above, when the Nepalese goods arrive at the Kolkata port by truck and are then unloaded and loaded onto a ship, that specific act of transferring the cargo is "transshipment." Transshipment is a vital part of modern containerized shipping, allowing cargo to be moved efficiently across different vessels and transport modes.

**(f) What are the main driving forces of the globalization process?**

Globalization, the process of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence among the world's societies, economies, and cultures, is driven by a powerful confluence of forces. The main drivers can be categorized as follows:

1.  **Technological Drivers:** This is arguably the most powerful force. The development of microprocessors and the internet has created a global infrastructure for instant communication and information sharing. Advances in transportation technology, especially containerization in shipping and affordable air freight, have dramatically reduced the cost and time required to move goods around the world.
2.  **Economic Drivers:** The rise of Multinational Corporations (MNCs) seeking to reduce costs and access new markets has led to the creation of global supply chains. The liberalization of international trade and capital markets, promoted by institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has dismantled barriers to the free flow of goods, services, and investment.
3.  **Political and Ideological Drivers:** The end of the Cold War and the subsequent decline of command economies led to the widespread adoption of market-oriented, neoliberal economic policies. This created a political environment favorable to deregulation, privatization, and free trade, which greatly accelerated the process of global economic integration.

**(g) What is the difference between government and state?**

The distinction between 'state' and 'government' is a fundamental concept in political science. While often used interchangeably in casual conversation, they are distinct entities.

*   **The State** is the permanent, abstract political entity that possesses sovereignty over a defined territory and population. It is the enduring political and legal framework of a society. The state is characterized by its four essential elements: **population, territory, government, and sovereignty**. The state is an impersonal and continuous institution; the state of Bangladesh, for example, has existed continuously since 1971.

*   **The Government** is the temporary machinery or agency through which the will of the state is formulated, expressed, and executed. It is the concrete organization of individuals and institutions (e.g., the cabinet, legislature, civil service) that exercises political authority on behalf of the state at any given time. Governments are transient; they change through elections, resignations, or revolutions, while the state itself persists. In essence, the state is the ship, and the government is the crew that steers it.

**(h) Briefly write about the Bretton Woods institutions.**

The Bretton Woods institutions are the cornerstones of the post-World War II global economic order. They were created at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA, in 1944. The primary goal of the conference was to establish a framework for economic cooperation and development that would prevent a repeat of the competitive devaluations and protectionism that had contributed to the Great Depression and the outbreak of the war.

The two principal institutions established were:
1.  **The International Monetary Fund (IMF):** Its original purpose was to promote international monetary cooperation, ensure the stability of exchange rates (under a system of fixed rates pegged to the U.S. dollar), and provide short-term loans to countries facing balance-of-payments difficulties.
2.  **The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD):** Commonly known as the **World Bank**, its initial mandate was to finance the reconstruction of war-torn European nations. It later shifted its focus to providing long-term loans and technical assistance for development projects in developing countries.

Together with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was signed later and eventually evolved into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the IMF and the World Bank formed the three pillars of the Bretton Woods system, designed to regulate and promote a stable, open, and prosperous global economy.

**(i) What is Copyright?**

**Copyright** is a form of intellectual property law that grants the creator of an original creative work exclusive rights for its use and distribution. It is a legal concept designed to protect the expression of an idea, not the idea itself.

*   **What it Protects:** Copyright applies to original works of authorship, including literary works (books, articles), dramatic works (plays), musical works (compositions, lyrics), artistic works (paintings, photographs), software, and architectural designs.
*   **Exclusive Rights:** The rights granted to a copyright holder typically include the exclusive right to:
    *   Reproduce or make copies of the work.
    *   Prepare derivative works based upon the original.
    *   Distribute copies of the work to the public.
    *   Perform or display the work publicly.
*   **Purpose:** The dual purpose of copyright is to provide a financial incentive for authors, artists, and creators to produce new works (by allowing them to profit from their creations) and thereby enrich the public domain and cultural life of society in the long run. The protection is granted for a limited period, after which the work enters the public domain.

**(j) Briefly write about the functions of the WTO.**

The **World Trade Organization (WTO)** is the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. Established in 1995 as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), its primary purpose is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible.

The main functions of the WTO are:
1.  **Administering Trade Agreements:** It oversees the implementation and administration of the various trade agreements negotiated by its members, which cover goods, services, and intellectual property.
2.  **Forum for Trade Negotiations:** The WTO provides a forum for its members to negotiate new trade rules and to liberalize trade further. This is done through rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, such as the Doha Development Round.
3.  **Settling Trade Disputes:** This is one of its most critical functions. The WTO has a binding dispute settlement mechanism to resolve trade conflicts between member countries in a rules-based manner, preventing unilateral trade wars.
4.  **Reviewing National Trade Policies:** Through its Trade Policy Review Mechanism, the WTO regularly examines the trade policies and practices of its member countries to ensure transparency and compliance with WTO rules.
5.  **Technical Assistance for Developing Countries:** The WTO provides technical assistance and training for developing and least-developed countries to help them build their trading capacity and better integrate into the global trading system.

**(k) What steps has ASEAN taken to achieve economic prosperity?**

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has taken a series of coordinated and strategic steps to achieve economic prosperity and integration among its member states. The centerpiece of this effort is the **ASEAN Economic Community (AEC)**.

The key steps and initiatives undertaken are:
1.  **Establishment of a Free Trade Area:** The first major step was the creation of the **ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)** in 1992. Its main tool was the **Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT)** scheme, which progressively reduced tariffs on most goods traded within the region, fostering intra-ASEAN trade.
2.  **Creation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC):** Formally launched in 2015, the AEC aims to transform ASEAN into a region with the following characteristics:
    *   **A single market and production base:** This involves the free flow of goods, services, investment, capital, and skilled labor across the region.
    *   **A highly competitive economic region:** This includes cooperation on competition policy, consumer protection, and intellectual property rights.
    *   **A region of equitable economic development:** This aims to narrow the development gap among member states through initiatives for SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprise) development.
    *   **A region fully integrated into the global economy:** This involves harmonizing trade and investment policies and pursuing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with key external partners like China, Japan, and India.
3.  **Enhancing Connectivity:** ASEAN places a strong emphasis on physical and institutional connectivity through the **Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC)**, which focuses on developing infrastructure, improving logistics, and streamlining customs and immigration procedures.

**(l) What is meant by Balance of Power? Discuss briefly.**

**Balance of Power** is a central concept in realist theory of international relations. It refers to a state of affairs in which power is distributed among states or coalitions of states in such a way that no single state or bloc is strong enough to dominate all the others and impose its will. The primary objective of a balance of power system is to prevent the emergence of a hegemon and thereby preserve the sovereignty, security, and independence of all states within the system.

A balance of power can be maintained through two primary mechanisms:
1.  **Internal Balancing:** A state builds up its own capabilities—by increasing its military strength, developing its economy, and enhancing its technological prowess—to counter a rising power.
2.  **External Balancing:** States form alliances with other states to counter a common, more powerful threat. This is the most common form of balancing.

The classic historical example is the Concert of Europe in the 19th century, where the great powers of Britain, Russia, Prussia, Austria, and France maneuvered through alliances and diplomacy to prevent any one of them from dominating the continent after the Napoleonic Wars. The concept remains highly relevant today in describing the strategic interactions between major powers like the United States, China, and Russia.

Of course. Here are the detailed, essay-style answers for questions 2 and 3 from the "International Affairs" examination paper, as requested.

***

### **2. Answer any three of the following questions:**

*(Note: For the purpose of providing a comprehensive resource, answers to all four questions are provided below.)*

**(a) Identify the important issues in Bangladesh-India bilateral relations.**

The bilateral relationship between Bangladesh and India is one of the most consequential and complex in South Asia. It is a relationship rooted in shared history, culture, and language, and solidified by India's critical support during the 1971 Liberation War. However, despite this deep-seated friendship, the relationship is characterized by a number of persistent and important issues that require continuous dialogue and careful management.

The most significant issues in the bilateral relationship can be identified as follows:

**1. Water Sharing of Trans-boundary Rivers:** This is arguably the most critical and emotionally charged issue. Bangladesh and India share 54 common rivers, but a comprehensive water-sharing agreement exists only for the Ganges (Ganges Water Treaty, 1996). The lack of a treaty for the Teesta River remains a major point of contention, as the diversion of water upstream in India severely impacts agriculture and livelihoods in northern Bangladesh during the dry season. A long-term, basin-wide management approach for all common rivers is a pressing need for Bangladesh.

**2. Border Management and Security:** While the two countries have successfully resolved their long-standing land boundary dispute through the implementation of the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA), issues related to border management persist. These include:
*   **Border Killings:** The killing of unarmed Bangladeshi civilians by Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) is a recurring issue that causes significant public outrage in Bangladesh and acts as a major irritant in the relationship.
*   **Transnational Crime:** Effectively managing cross-border smuggling, human trafficking, and the movement of insurgents requires continuous and robust security cooperation between the two nations.

**3. Trade and Economic Cooperation:** India is one of Bangladesh's largest trading partners, but the trade balance is heavily tilted in India's favor. While India has granted duty-free access for most Bangladeshi products, non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and para-tariff barriers—such as complex customs procedures, testing requirements, and inadequate infrastructure at land ports—continue to impede Bangladeshi exports to the vast Indian market. Overcoming these barriers is a key priority for Bangladesh.

**4. Connectivity and Transit:** Enhancing regional connectivity is a shared goal, and Bangladesh has granted transit and transshipment facilities to India, allowing it to more easily access its northeastern states via Bangladeshi territory. For Bangladesh, the key issue is ensuring that it derives equitable economic benefits from these arrangements through fees and the development of its own transport and logistics infrastructure, and that these arrangements do not compromise its national security.

**5. Regional Geopolitics:** The growing strategic rivalry between India and China in the region places Bangladesh in a delicate position. Maintaining its strategic autonomy while balancing robust economic and developmental partnerships with both Asian giants, without being drawn into their competition, is a paramount diplomatic challenge for Bangladesh.

In conclusion, while the Bangladesh-India relationship has reached a high point of cooperation, particularly in areas like security and connectivity, a sustainable and truly "neighborly" partnership hinges on the amicable and just resolution of these outstanding issues, especially concerning water sharing and border management.

**(b) Discuss the causes of the recent political crisis in Syria.**

The Syrian crisis, which erupted in 2011, is one of the most complex and devastating conflicts of the 21st century. It began as a domestic uprising but rapidly devolved into a multi-sided civil war with deep international involvement. The causes of the crisis are a potent mix of long-term political and socio-economic grievances and short-term triggers.

**Long-Term Causes:**

1.  **Authoritarian Rule and Political Repression:** For over four decades, Syria was ruled by the al-Assad family (first Hafez, then his son Bashar) under a repressive, one-party Ba'athist state. The regime tolerated no dissent, with powerful security services (the *Mukhabarat*) crushing any opposition. This created a deep well of pent-up demand for political freedom and an end to authoritarian rule.
2.  **Sectarian Tensions:** While the Ba'athist regime was officially secular, its top echelons of power in the military and security apparatus were dominated by members of the Alawite sect, a minority offshoot of Shia Islam, to which the Assad family belongs. This fostered resentment among the country's Sunni Muslim majority, who felt marginalized and oppressed. This underlying sectarian fault line was easily exploited once the conflict began.
3.  **Socio-Economic Grievances:** In the years leading up to 2011, Syria faced significant economic challenges. Neoliberal economic reforms had benefited a small, crony-capitalist elite connected to the regime while exacerbating poverty and inequality for the masses. A severe drought from 2006 to 2011 devastated rural communities, forcing hundreds of thousands of farmers to migrate to already overcrowded and impoverished urban peripheries, creating a large population of discontented and unemployed youth.

**Short-Term Trigger: The Arab Spring**

The immediate trigger for the crisis was the wave of pro-democracy protests sweeping across the Arab world in 2011, known as the "Arab Spring." Inspired by the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, peaceful protests erupted in the Syrian city of Deraa in March 2011 after a group of teenagers were arrested and tortured for writing anti-government graffiti.

**Descent into Civil War:**

The regime's response to these peaceful protests was not reform, but brutal force. Security forces fired on unarmed demonstrators, leading to more protests and more violence. This savage crackdown militarized the opposition, as defectors from the army formed the Free Syrian Army (FSA) to protect protestors, and ordinary citizens took up arms. The conflict rapidly escalated and became internationalized:
*   **Regional Powers:** Sunni powers like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey began supporting various rebel factions to topple the Assad regime. Conversely, Shia power Iran, along with its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, intervened decisively to prop up its crucial Alawite-led ally.
*   **Global Powers:** Russia, a long-standing ally of Syria with a key naval base in the country, provided critical military, economic, and diplomatic support (including vetoes at the UN Security Council) to ensure the Assad regime's survival. The United States and its Western allies provided limited support to what they considered "moderate" rebel groups.
*   **Rise of Jihadist Groups:** The chaos of the war created a vacuum that was exploited by extremist jihadist groups, most notoriously the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which carved out a "caliphate" across large swathes of Syria and Iraq, adding another horrific dimension to the conflict.

In conclusion, the Syrian crisis was caused by a combustible mix of decades of political oppression and economic hardship, ignited by the spark of the Arab Spring, and fanned into a catastrophic inferno by the regime's brutality and the subsequent intervention of rival regional and global powers.

**(c) Determine the nature of Sino-American relations.**

Sino-American relations, the bilateral relationship between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America, represent the most consequential and complex geopolitical dynamic of the 21st century. The nature of this relationship is profoundly paradoxical, best characterized as a dynamic of **comprehensive strategic competition coexisting with deep economic interdependence**. It is a relationship that defies simple labels like "friend" or "foe," encompassing elements of rivalry, competition, and, in limited areas, cooperation.

The nature of the relationship can be determined by examining its key dimensions:

**1. The Economic Dimension: "Co-opetition" and Interdependence**
For decades, the economic relationship was the bedrock of stability. China's role as the "world's factory" and America's role as the world's largest consumer created a deeply intertwined and symbiotic relationship. China became the largest holder of U.S. debt, and American corporations relied heavily on Chinese supply chains and markets. However, this interdependence is now a source of friction. The U.S. accuses China of unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft, and industrial espionage. This has led to trade wars, tariffs, and a U.S. push for "de-risking" or "decoupling"—an effort to reduce its economic reliance on China, especially in critical technologies like semiconductors. The relationship is thus one of intense competition, or "co-opetition," where economic ties are both a source of mutual benefit and a strategic vulnerability.

**2. The Geopolitical and Military Dimension: Intensifying Rivalry**
This is the most adversarial aspect of the relationship. The United States views China's rapid military modernization and its increasingly assertive actions in the South China Sea as a direct challenge to the U.S.-led, rules-based international order that has prevailed since World War II. China, in turn, views the U.S. network of alliances in the Indo-Pacific (with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines) and strategic partnerships like the Quad (U.S., Japan, India, Australia) and AUKUS (Australia, UK, U.S.) as a containment strategy aimed at encircling China and thwarting its rise. The status of Taiwan is the most dangerous flashpoint, with the U.S. committed to helping Taiwan defend itself and China viewing the island as a renegade province to be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary.

**3. The Ideological Dimension: A Contest of Systems**
At its core, the Sino-American relationship is a contest between two fundamentally different political and ideological systems. The U.S. champions liberal democracy, human rights, and individual freedoms. It views China's authoritarian, state-capitalist model, and its human rights record in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as a threat to these values. China, on the other hand, promotes its model as a more efficient alternative for development and views U.S. advocacy for democracy as a pretext for interfering in its internal affairs and instigating "color revolutions."

In conclusion, the nature of Sino-American relations is one of an emerging great power rivalry that permeates every domain—economic, military, technological, and ideological. While the deep economic entanglement acts as a partial brake on outright conflict, the underlying trend is one of escalating competition and strategic mistrust, defining the central geopolitical challenge of our time.

**(d) (i) What are the arguments for increasing the number of permanent members of the UN Security Council?**

The debate over reforming the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), particularly by increasing the number of its permanent, veto-wielding members, is a long-standing and central issue in international relations. The arguments for expansion are compelling and are rooted in the need to make the Council more representative, effective, and legitimate in the 21st century.

The primary arguments are:

1.  **Reflecting Contemporary Geopolitical Realities:** The current composition of the P5 (Permanent Five: USA, UK, France, Russia, China) reflects the power balance of 1945, at the end of World War II. The world has changed dramatically since then. The argument is that the UNSC must be updated to include major powers that have emerged since, such as **Germany, Japan, India, and Brazil** (collectively known as the G4), as well as representation from **Africa and Latin America**, continents that are completely excluded from permanent membership.
2.  **Enhancing Legitimacy and Representativeness:** A Council dominated by five powers from the mid-20th century suffers from a serious legitimacy deficit. Its decisions are often seen as serving the interests of the P5 rather than the broader international community. Expanding permanent membership to include countries from under-represented regions would make the Council more geographically balanced and its decisions more likely to be seen as legitimate and accepted by the wider UN membership.
3.  **Improving Effectiveness and Burden-Sharing:** Proponents argue that bringing major regional powers and significant financial and military contributors to the UN into the Council's permanent core would enhance its effectiveness. These new members would bring new perspectives, resources, and influence, making the Council better equipped to address complex global peace and security challenges. It would also lead to a more equitable sharing of the burden of maintaining international peace and security.
4.  **Addressing the Inequity of the Veto:** While reforming the veto itself is difficult, expanding the number of permanent members is seen by some as a way to dilute the power of the existing P5. A more diverse permanent membership might create new dynamics and make it harder for a single P5 member to dominate the Council's agenda.

**(ii) Discuss Bangladesh's participation in UN peacekeeping missions.**

Bangladesh's participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions is a cornerstone of its foreign policy and one of its most significant contributions to international peace and security. Since its first deployment in 1988, Bangladesh has emerged as one of the world's largest and most consistent troop- and police-contributing countries.

The nature and significance of Bangladesh's participation can be discussed as follows:

1.  **Scale and Scope of Contribution:** Bangladesh has deployed tens of thousands of peacekeepers—including soldiers, naval personnel, airmen, and police officers (both male and female)—to some of the most challenging UN missions across the globe, from Africa (e.g., DR Congo, Mali, South Sudan) and the Middle East to the Caribbean (Haiti).
2.  **Motivations and Foreign Policy Objectives:** Bangladesh's robust participation is driven by several factors. It is a tangible expression of its constitutional commitment to promoting international peace and solidarity (Article 25). It enhances the country's international image and "brand" as a responsible and reliable global citizen. It also provides valuable professional experience and training for its armed forces and police, and the financial reimbursements from the UN are a significant source of foreign currency.
3.  **Professionalism and Reputation:** Bangladeshi peacekeepers have earned a global reputation for their professionalism, discipline, compassion, and effectiveness. They are often praised for their ability to engage with local communities, undertaking humanitarian and "quick impact" projects like building schools and medical clinics, which go beyond their traditional security mandates and help in winning the "hearts and minds" of the local population.
4.  **Promoting Women in Peacekeeping:** Bangladesh has been a champion of increasing the participation of women in peacekeeping. It was one of the first countries to deploy an all-female Formed Police Unit (FPU), setting a powerful example and contributing to the effectiveness of missions, particularly in engaging with female and child victims of conflict.

In conclusion, Bangladesh's deep and sustained commitment to UN peacekeeping is a defining feature of its role in the world. It is a policy that not only serves the cause of global peace but also significantly enhances the nation's own diplomatic standing and the professional capacity of its uniformed services.

### **3. Discuss the measures taken for the solution and prevention of recurrence of the problem of the theft of Bangladesh Bank's reserves from the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.**

The theft of US$81 million from the Bangladesh Bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February 2016 was one of the largest and most audacious cyber-heists in history. It exposed critical vulnerabilities in both international financial systems and Bangladesh's own cybersecurity infrastructure. In response, a multi-pronged approach encompassing technical, legal, and administrative measures has been undertaken to solve the immediate problem and prevent its recurrence.

**Measures Taken for Solution (Recovery of Stolen Funds):**

1.  **International Legal and Diplomatic Action:** The primary focus has been on recovering the stolen funds, most of which were laundered through the casino industry in the Philippines.
    *   Bangladesh Bank, with the help of the government, initiated legal proceedings in the U.S. courts against the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) of the Philippines and other entities allegedly involved in the heist. This lawsuit seeks to hold them accountable and compel them to return the stolen money.
    *   Intensive diplomatic engagement with the authorities in the Philippines and other relevant jurisdictions has been pursued to secure their cooperation in the investigation and recovery efforts. A portion of the money was successfully recovered from a casino junket operator in the Philippines.
2.  **Collaboration with International Agencies:** Bangladesh Bank has collaborated extensively with international agencies, including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and financial intelligence units in several countries, to trace the money trail and identify the perpetrators, who are widely believed to be a state-sponsored North Korean hacking group.

**Measures Taken for Prevention of Recurrence:**

Recognizing that recovery is a difficult and protracted process, the more critical task has been to overhaul security systems to prevent a similar incident from happening again.

1.  **Technical and Cybersecurity Overhaul:** This has been the most immediate and crucial area of reform within Bangladesh Bank.
    *   **System Segregation:** The real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system and the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) messaging platform, which was compromised, were immediately segregated. A physical "air gap" was created to ensure that the critical domestic payment system could not be accessed from the international messaging system.
    *   **Strengthening Network Security:** A complete overhaul of the bank's IT infrastructure was undertaken. This included installing more advanced firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and implementing multi-factor authentication for all critical transactions.
    *   **24/7 Monitoring:** A state-of-the-art, round-the-clock Security Operations Center (SOC) was established to continuously monitor all network traffic and financial transactions for any suspicious activity.
2.  **Administrative and Procedural Reforms:** The heist revealed shocking procedural lapses.
    *   **Enhanced Checks and Balances:** A "maker-checker" system with multiple layers of authorization was implemented for all large-value international transactions. No single individual can now initiate and approve a payment order.
    *   **Human Resource Development:** Extensive training programs on cybersecurity awareness have been made mandatory for all relevant officials. The bank has also moved to hire dedicated cybersecurity experts and professionals.
3.  **National Level Coordination:** The government established the Bangladesh e-Government Computer Incident Response Team (BGD e-GOV CIRT) to act as a national focal point for responding to cyber threats across all government institutions, not just the central bank. This ensures better coordination and information sharing on cyber threats.

In conclusion, the Bangladesh Bank heist served as a brutal wake-up call. The response has involved a dual strategy: a persistent international legal and diplomatic effort to recover the stolen assets, and, more importantly, a comprehensive and fundamental overhaul of technical, procedural, and administrative security measures to build a more resilient defense against the sophisticated cyber threats of the modern financial world.

Of course. Here are the detailed, essay-style answers for questions 1 and 2 from the "Bangladesh Affairs" examination paper, as requested.

### **1. (a) What is the importance of the coral island in the geography of Bangladesh?**

In the geography of Bangladesh, the coral island, specifically **St. Martin's Island**, holds a unique and disproportionately large importance despite its small size. It is the country's only coral island, and its significance is multidimensional, spanning ecological, economic, and strategic domains.

**Ecological Importance:**
St. Martin's Island is a critical hub of marine biodiversity. Its surrounding waters and coral reefs host a rich ecosystem of fish, mollusks, algae, and a variety of rare and endangered marine species, including several species of sea turtles that use its beaches for nesting. The coral structures themselves are vital ecosystems that protect the coastline from erosion and storm surges. The island, along with its adjacent waters, has been declared an Ecologically Critical Area (ECA) and more recently a Marine Protected Area (MPA) to preserve this unique natural heritage. It serves as a living laboratory for marine biologists and environmental scientists studying the impacts of climate change on coral ecosystems.

**Economic and Touristic Importance:**
The island is Bangladesh's premier marine tourism destination. Its pristine sandy beaches, clear blue waters, and vibrant underwater life attract thousands of domestic and international tourists annually. This tourism industry is a significant source of livelihood for the local population and generates valuable revenue for the national economy.

**Geostrategic Importance:**
Strategically, St. Martin's Island enhances Bangladesh's maritime presence in the Bay of Bengal. Located at the southernmost point of the country, it serves as a forward base for the Bangladesh Navy and Coast Guard to monitor maritime traffic, combat piracy and smuggling, and assert the nation's sovereignty over its extensive maritime boundaries, which were successfully demarcated through international legal victories.

In summary, St. Martin's Island's importance far exceeds its physical size. It is an irreplaceable ecological treasure, a vital economic asset for tourism, and a key strategic outpost for the nation.

### **1. (b) What do you understand by the inactive deltas of Bangladesh?**

The term "inactive deltas" in the context of Bangladesh's geography refers to the older, more mature parts of the vast Bengal Delta that are no longer being actively built up by the regular deposition of silt from river floods. The Bengal Delta is a dynamic system, and over millennia, the primary courses of the major rivers like the Ganges and Brahmaputra have shifted.

The southwestern part of Bangladesh, particularly the region covering Jessore, Kushtia, and parts of Khulna, is often referred to as the **moribund or inactive delta**. In this region, the rivers and distributaries that once carried enormous amounts of silt have either decayed, silted up, or shifted their main flow eastward. As a result, this area no longer receives the annual life-giving deposits of fresh alluvium.

The key characteristics and implications of an inactive delta are:
*   The land elevation is relatively higher and more stable compared to the active delta.
*   The rivers are often tidal but carry less freshwater flow, making the region more susceptible to salinity intrusion from the Bay of Bengal.
*   The natural process of land subsidence is no longer counteracted by new sediment deposition, which can lead to long-term waterlogging issues.

Understanding the distinction between the active, tidal, and inactive parts of the delta is crucial for agricultural planning, water resource management, and developing strategies to combat the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise in Bangladesh.

### **1. (c) Describe the importance of the Barind Tract and the Varendra Museum in the geography of Bangladesh.**

**The Barind Tract (বরেন্দ্র অঞ্চল):**
The Barind Tract is a distinctive and significant physiographic unit in the geography of Bangladesh. It is a large, elevated block of older, reddish Pleistocene-era alluvium, located in the northwestern part of the country, primarily spanning the greater Rajshahi, Dinajpur, and Bogura regions.

Its importance lies in its unique characteristics, which contrast sharply with the surrounding floodplains:
*   **Geological and Agricultural Significance:** As one of the oldest landforms in the country, its soil composition and topography are different. The land is undulating, and the soil is less fertile, clayey, and harder than the recent floodplain soils. This makes it a distinct agro-ecological zone, prone to drought. Its unique geology has necessitated specific agricultural adaptations, including the development of deep tube well irrigation to support rice cultivation, particularly of drought-resistant varieties.
*   **Archaeological Importance:** Being an ancient and elevated landmass, protected from the ravages of frequent floods, the Barind Tract became a cradle of early civilization in Bengal. It is home to some of Bangladesh's most important archaeological sites, including the ruins of the Somapura Mahavihara at Paharpur (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) and Mahasthangarh, the ancient capital of Pundravardhana.

**The Varendra Research Museum (বরেন্দ্র জাদুঘর):**
Located in Rajshahi, in the heart of the Barind Tract, the Varendra Research Museum is the oldest museum in Bangladesh, established in 1910. Its importance is immense.
*   **A Repository of Regional History:** The museum was specifically founded to collect, preserve, and study the rich archaeological and historical artifacts discovered in the Barind region. It houses an unparalleled collection of ancient sculptures (stone and bronze), terracotta plaques, coins, inscriptions, and manuscripts dating back to the Pala, Sena, and other ancient and medieval dynasties that flourished in the region.
*   **Cultural and Educational Hub:** It serves as a vital center for historical research and education. The museum's collection provides invaluable physical evidence for understanding the history, art, culture, and religious evolution (Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam) of ancient and medieval Bengal. It is an indispensable resource for historians, archaeologists, and students, and a key cultural institution that preserves the glorious heritage of the Barind Tract.

### **1. (d) What is the historical importance of the Central Shaheed Minar, the National Mausoleum, and the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban?**

These three architectural landmarks are not merely buildings; they are powerful, tangible symbols that encapsulate the core spirit, struggles, and aspirations of the Bangladeshi nation.

**Central Shaheed Minar (কেন্দ্রীয় শহীদ মিনার):**
Located in Dhaka, the Central Shaheed Minar is the national monument established to commemorate the martyrs of the 1952 Language Movement.
*   **Symbol of Linguistic and Cultural Nationalism:** Its historical importance is profound. It symbolizes the Bengali people's struggle to defend the honor of their mother tongue, Bangla. This movement was the first successful assertion of Bengali identity against West Pakistani cultural and political domination, and it sowed the seeds of Bengali nationalism that ultimately culminated in the Liberation War of 1971. The Shaheed Minar is the embodiment of this linguistic pride and the spirit of secular, cultural nationalism. Annually, the observance of 'Ekushey February' (21st February) at the Minar, which is now recognized as UNESCO's International Mother Language Day, reaffirms this legacy.

**National Mausoleum (জাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধ):**
Located at Savar, the National Mausoleum is the national monument dedicated to the memory of the millions of martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the 1971 Liberation War.
*   **Symbol of Independence and Sacrifice:** Its seven triangular spires represent the seven major phases of the movement for independence, beginning with the Language Movement of 1952 and culminating in the final victory of 1971. It is the nation's most solemn and sacred monument, a place of pilgrimage where citizens and foreign dignitaries pay homage to the immeasurable sacrifice that led to the birth of an independent Bangladesh. It embodies the nation's profound sense of gratitude, its unyielding spirit of resistance against oppression, and the ultimate triumph of freedom.

**Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban (জাতীয় সংসদ ভবন):**
The Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban is the house of the Parliament of Bangladesh and an architectural masterpiece designed by the renowned American architect Louis I. Kahn.
*   **Symbol of Democracy and Sovereignty:** Its historical importance lies in what it represents: the democratic aspirations of the Bangladeshi people. It is the physical embodiment of the constitutional principle that "all powers in the Republic belong to the people." As the seat of the nation's legislature, it is where the elected representatives of the people convene to make laws, hold the government accountable, and exercise the sovereign will of the nation. Its monumental and modernist architecture, with its use of geometric shapes and interplay of light, is often interpreted as a metaphor for a new, modern, and enlightened democratic nation rising from the ashes of conflict.

### **2. (a) Describe the significance of the 1952 Language Movement in the emergence of Bengali nationalism.**

The 1952 Language Movement was not merely a protest for linguistic rights; it was the seminal event that forged a new political consciousness and laid the foundational cornerstone for Bengali nationalism, ultimately leading to the creation of Bangladesh. Its significance is profound and transformative.

1.  **Awakening of a Secular, Cultural Identity:** Prior to 1952, the primary basis of political identity in Pakistan was religion. The Language Movement fundamentally challenged this. By demanding recognition for Bangla, the Bengali people asserted that their identity was defined not just by their religion (Islam) but more powerfully by their shared language, literature, and culture. It was the first powerful articulation of a secular, linguistic-cultural nationalism that transcended religious identity.
2.  **First Successful Challenge to West Pakistani Domination:** The attempt by the Pakistani ruling elite to impose Urdu as the sole state language was seen by the Bengalis as an act of cultural imperialism and a symbol of their political and economic subjugation. The successful resistance against this imposition was the first major political victory for the people of East Bengal. It shattered the myth of Pakistani national unity and proved that the Bengali people could successfully challenge the hegemony of the West Pakistani establishment.
3.  **Creation of a Potent Symbolism and a Martyr's Legacy:** The sacrifice of the language martyrs on February 21, 1952—Salam, Barkat, Rafiq, Jabbar, and others—created a powerful and enduring legacy. The "Shaheed Minar" became a sacred symbol of resistance and a rallying point for all subsequent political movements. The annual observance of 'Ekushey February' became a recurring ceremony that renewed the spirit of Bengali nationalism and kept the memory of the struggle alive for a new generation.
4.  **Sowing the Seeds of Political Separation:** The Language Movement exposed the deep cultural and political chasm between the two wings of Pakistan. It made the Bengali middle class and intelligentsia realize that their cultural, economic, and political aspirations could not be fulfilled within the framework of a united Pakistan dominated by a hostile elite. This realization set in motion a chain of political movements—from the demand for autonomy in the Six-Point Program to the final struggle for independence in 1971—all of which drew their inspiration and ideological strength from the spirit of '52.

In essence, the 1952 Language Movement was the crucible in which the modern Bengali national identity was forged. It provided the ideological basis, the political momentum, and the emotional fervor for the long struggle that would culminate nineteen years later in the birth of an independent Bangladesh.

### **2. (b) Discuss the importance of the 1969 mass uprising in the liberation war of Bangladesh.**

The 1969 mass uprising, or *Gono Obbhutthan*, was a cataclysmic and decisive event in the political history of Bangladesh. It served as the final, powerful surge in the long movement for autonomy and acted as a direct prelude to the 1971 Liberation War. Its importance cannot be overstated.

1.  **Unification of All Classes and Political Forces:** The uprising was unique in its scale and scope. It transcended the boundaries of student and political activism and drew in people from all walks of life—workers, peasants, civil servants, and professionals. The movement was centered around the Awami League's **Six-Point Program** and the students' **Eleven-Point Program**, which combined the demand for regional autonomy with socialist demands for workers' and peasants' rights. This created a powerful, united front against the military regime.
2.  **The Fall of the Ayub Regime:** The mass uprising dealt a death blow to the decade-long military dictatorship of Field Marshal Ayub Khan. The relentless waves of protests, strikes, and processions made the country ungovernable and forced Ayub Khan to resign in March 1969. This victory shattered the aura of invincibility around the powerful Pakistani military establishment and instilled a profound sense of empowerment and confidence in the Bengali people.
3.  **Securing the Release of Political Prisoners:** A key achievement of the uprising was securing the unconditional release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from prison. He had been incarcerated under the infamous Agartala Conspiracy Case, a trial designed to permanently remove him from the political scene. His release as a triumphant hero, and his subsequent bestowment with the title **"Bangabandhu"** (Friend of Bengal) at a massive public reception, firmly established him as the undisputed and sole leader of the Bengali people.
4.  **Paving the Way for the 1970 Election:** The collapse of the Ayub regime forced his successor, General Yahya Khan, to concede to the key political demands of holding a general election based on universal adult franchise and representation based on population. This was a monumental victory, as it guaranteed East Pakistan a majority of seats in the National Assembly. The 1969 uprising thus created the political conditions for the 1970 election, which would serve as the final, definitive referendum on the Bengali people's demand for self-rule.

In essence, the 1969 mass uprising was the dress rehearsal for the 1971 Liberation War. It unified the nation, toppled a military dictator, solidified the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and forced the critical election that would set the stage for the final, armed struggle for independence.

### **2. (c) Review the impact of the 1970 general election on the struggle for Bangladesh's independence.**

The 1970 general election was the most pivotal political event in the history of Pakistan and served as the final, peaceful, and democratic verdict that made the struggle for Bangladesh's independence inevitable. Its impact was absolute and decisive.

1.  **A Referendum on the Six-Point Program:** The Awami League, under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, contested the election on a single-issue platform: the **Six-Point Program**. This program called for a federal system with complete provincial autonomy, leaving only defense and foreign affairs to the central government. The election was, therefore, not a normal contest between parties but a clear referendum on whether the Bengali people supported this charter for self-rule.
2.  **Landslide Victory and an Undisputed Mandate:** The election results were a political earthquake. The Awami League won a stunning landslide victory, securing 167 out of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan in the National Assembly. This gave the Awami League an absolute majority of 167 seats in the 313-seat all-Pakistan National Assembly. This overwhelming victory provided Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with an unassailable and democratically legitimate mandate to speak for the entire Bengali nation. He was no longer just a regional leader; he was the Prime Minister-elect of Pakistan with the constitutional authority to frame a new constitution based on the Six-Point Program.
3.  **Exposure of the West Pakistani Elite's Intransigence:** The most profound impact of the election was the reaction it provoked from the West Pakistani military-bureaucratic elite and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which had won a majority in West Pakistan. They refused to accept the people's verdict. Bhutto infamously declared he would not allow the Assembly to convene, and the military ruler, General Yahya Khan, postponed the session indefinitely. This intransigence exposed their utter contempt for democracy and their refusal to hand over power to the elected Bengali leadership.
4.  **Legitimizing the Struggle for Independence:** This refusal to honor the election results closed all doors for a peaceful political settlement within the framework of Pakistan. It proved to the Bengali people, and to the world, that their democratic rights would never be respected. It thus stripped the Pakistani regime of all moral and legal authority to rule over East Bengal. It gave Bangabandhu the legitimate grounds to launch his Non-Cooperation Movement in March 1971 and ultimately justified the declaration of independence as the last resort to realize the democratic will of the people.

In summary, the 1970 election transformed the demand for autonomy into a legitimate mandate for self-rule. The subsequent refusal to honor this mandate destroyed the foundation of Pakistan and made the armed struggle for an independent Bangladesh not only necessary but also righteous.

### **2. (d) What do you understand by the Mujibnagar Government?**

The Mujibnagar Government was the provisional government of Bangladesh-in-exile, formed on April 10, 1971, to lead the Bangladeshi Liberation War. It was the first government of an independent Bangladesh and provided the crucial political, administrative, and military leadership to the nine-month-long struggle for freedom.

It was formally proclaimed and its cabinet members took their oath of office on **April 17, 1971**, in a mango grove in the village of Baidyanathtala, Meherpur, which was subsequently renamed **Mujibnagar** in honor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

The key aspects of the Mujibnagar Government are:

1.  **Legitimacy and Structure:** Its legitimacy was derived from the landslide victory of the Awami League in the 1970 general election. It was formed by the elected representatives of the people. Its structure was:
    *   **President:** Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (who was imprisoned in Pakistan at the time)
    *   **Acting President:** Syed Nazrul Islam (who performed the presidential duties in Bangabandhu's absence)
    *   **Prime Minister:** Tajuddin Ahmad (who was the chief executive and architect of the wartime government)
    *   **Other key ministers:** A.H.M. Quamruzzaman, M. Mansur Ali, and Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad.
    *   **Commander-in-Chief of the Liberation Forces (Mukti Bahini):** Colonel (later General) M.A.G. Osmani.

2.  **Functions and Importance:** The Mujibnagar Government's role was vital.
    *   It provided a **central political command** for the war, preventing the resistance from splintering into disparate guerrilla groups.
    *   It **organized the Mukti Bahini** into a structured fighting force, dividing the country into 11 sectors for strategic operations.
    *   It conducted a highly effective **international diplomatic campaign** to gain global recognition, support, and humanitarian aid for the cause of Bangladesh.
    *   It **administered the liberated zones** within Bangladesh and managed the colossal humanitarian crisis of nearly 10 million refugees who had fled to India.

In essence, the Mujibnagar Government was the embodiment of the sovereign will of the Bangladeshi people during the Liberation War. It transformed a spontaneous popular resistance into an organized and politically directed national liberation struggle, ultimately leading to victory on December 16, 1971.

Of course. Here are the detailed, essay-style answers for questions 3, 4, and 5 from the "Bangladesh Affairs" examination paper, as requested.

***

### **3. (a) What are the fundamental principles of state policy in the 1972 Constitution of Bangladesh?**

The 1972 Constitution of Bangladesh, drafted in the aftermath of a historic Liberation War, enshrined a set of fundamental principles of state policy in its Part II. These principles were not merely abstract ideals; they were intended to be the philosophical and ideological soul of the new nation, representing the aspirations for which millions had fought and sacrificed. As stated in Article 8, these principles were to be fundamental to the governance of the country and serve as a guide for the interpretation of all laws.

The original four fundamental principles of state policy, often referred to as the four pillars, were:

1.  **Nationalism:** The Constitution identified **Bengali Nationalism** as a core principle. This nationalism was not based on religion or race, but on the shared bond of language, literature, and culture, and forged in the crucible of the united and determined struggle for national liberation in 1971. It was a secular, cultural nationalism that celebrated the unique identity of the Bengali people.
2.  **Socialism:** The principle of socialism was enshrined with the objective of establishing an **egalitarian society, free from the exploitation of man by man**. It aimed to ensure social and economic justice for all citizens through the equitable distribution of wealth and resources and to build a society where the basic necessities of life were guaranteed for all.
3.  **Democracy:** The Constitution committed the Republic to being a democracy where **fundamental human rights and freedoms would be guaranteed**, and where the government would be run by the elected representatives of the people. It affirmed the supreme principle that all powers in the Republic belong to the people.
4.  **Secularism:** This was a cornerstone principle reflecting the non-communal spirit of the Liberation War. Secularism in the 1972 Constitution meant the **elimination of all forms of religious discrimination**. It guaranteed the equal status of all religions and prohibited the state from granting political status to any particular religion, ensuring a separation of religion from state affairs.

These four principles—Nationalism, Socialism, Democracy, and Secularism—were the guiding stars of the 1972 Constitution, collectively outlining the vision of the just, progressive, and equitable society that Bangladesh aspired to become.

### **3. (b) What are the fundamental rights of the people according to the Constitution of Bangladesh?**

The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh guarantees a comprehensive set of fundamental rights for its citizens, primarily enumerated in Part III (Articles 26-47). These rights are the bedrock of individual liberty and are legally enforceable in a court of law. The High Court Division of the Supreme Court is empowered under Article 102 to issue orders or writs to enforce these rights.

The key fundamental rights include:

*   **Equality before Law (Article 27):** All citizens are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law.
*   **No Discrimination on Grounds of Religion, etc. (Article 28):** The state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
*   **Equality of Opportunity in Public Employment (Article 29):** There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in respect of public employment.
*   **Prohibition of Foreign Titles, etc. (Article 30):** No citizen shall, without the prior approval of the President, accept any title, honor, award, or decoration from any foreign state.
*   **Right to Protection of Law (Article 31):** To enjoy the protection of the law and to be treated in accordance with law is the inalienable right of every citizen.
*   **Protection of Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 32):** No person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.
*   **Safeguards as to Arrest and Detention (Article 33):** Provides safeguards for arrested persons, including the right to be informed of the grounds of arrest and the right to consult a legal practitioner.
*   **Prohibition of Forced Labour (Article 34):** All forms of forced labor are prohibited.
*   **Protection in respect of Trial and Punishment (Article 35):** Guarantees protection against retrospective punishment and double jeopardy, and ensures the right to a speedy and public trial.
*   **Freedom of Movement (Article 36):** Every citizen has the right to move freely throughout Bangladesh, to reside and settle in any place therein, and to leave and re-enter Bangladesh.
*   **Freedom of Assembly (Article 37):** Every citizen has the right to assemble and to participate in public meetings and processions peacefully and without arms.
*   **Freedom of Association (Article 38):** Every citizen has the right to form associations or unions.
*   **Freedom of Thought, Conscience, and Speech (Article 39):** Guarantees freedom of thought and conscience, and the freedom of speech and expression, as well as freedom of the press.
*   **Freedom of Profession or Occupation (Article 40):** Every citizen has the right to enter upon any lawful profession or occupation.
*   **Freedom of Religion (Article 41):** Every citizen has the right to profess, practice, or propagate any religion.
*   **Rights to Property (Article 42):** Every citizen has the right to acquire, hold, transfer, or otherwise dispose of property.
*   **Protection of Home and Correspondence (Article 43):** Every citizen has the right to the privacy of his correspondence and his home.

### **3. (c) Write down the rights of women mentioned in the Constitution of Bangladesh.**

The Constitution of Bangladesh is a progressive document that explicitly guarantees the rights of women and mandates the state to take affirmative action to ensure their equality and advancement. The rights of women are enshrined both within the general fundamental rights applicable to all citizens and through specific provisions aimed at promoting gender equality.

The key constitutional rights of women are:

1.  **Right to Equality:**
    *   **Article 27:** Guarantees that all citizens, including women, are **equal before the law** and entitled to equal protection of the law.
    *   **Article 28(1):** Explicitly prohibits discrimination on the ground of **sex**. It states, "The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth."
    .
2.  **Right to Equal Opportunity:**
    *   **Article 29(1) & (2):** Ensures that there shall be **equality of opportunity for all citizens** in respect of public employment, and that no citizen shall be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment on the ground of sex.

3.  **Mandate for Affirmative Action:**
    *   **Article 28(4):** This is a crucial enabling provision. It empowers the state to make **special provisions in favor of women or children**. This clause provides the constitutional basis for all affirmative actions, such as reserved seats for women in various bodies, special quotas in employment, and targeted programs for female education and health.

4.  **Representation in Local Government:**
    *   **Article 9:** While not a fundamental right, this principle of state policy mandates the encouragement of local government institutions. In practice, this has been implemented through laws that provide for **reserved seats for women** in all tiers of local government, from Union Parishads to City Corporations, ensuring their political participation at the grassroots level.

5.  **Representation in the National Parliament:**
    *   **Article 65(3):** Provides for a specific number of **reserved seats for women in the Jatiya Sangsad** (Parliament) in addition to their right to contest general seats. This ensures a minimum level of female representation in the national legislature.

These provisions collectively create a strong constitutional framework for protecting and advancing the rights of women in Bangladesh, committing the state not only to non-discrimination but also to the proactive promotion of gender equality in all spheres of national life.

### **3. (d) "All powers in the Republic belong to the people." - Explain in accordance with the relevant article of the Constitution of Bangladesh.**

The declaration "All powers in the Republic belong to the people" is the foundational democratic principle of the Constitution of Bangladesh. This powerful statement is enshrined in **Article 7(1)** of the Constitution. This article is not merely a rhetorical flourish; it is the philosophical and legal cornerstone upon which the entire edifice of the state is built, establishing the principle of **popular sovereignty**.

**Explanation in Accordance with Article 7:**

**Article 7(1)** states: "All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution."

**Article 7(2)** further reinforces this by declaring: "This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void."

The explanation of this principle is as follows:

1.  **Source of All Authority:** Article 7(1) unequivocally establishes the people as the ultimate source of all state power. This means that the government, the legislature, the judiciary, and all other state organs do not possess power in their own right. They are merely trustees or agents who exercise power on behalf of the people.
2.  **Power Exercised through the Constitution:** The people exercise their sovereign power through the mechanism of the Constitution. The Constitution is the "solemn expression of the will of the people." Therefore, all state actions must be performed "only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution." No person or institution can claim to have power that is not derived from or sanctioned by the Constitution.
3.  **Supremacy of the Constitution:** Article 7(2) establishes the supremacy of the Constitution as the embodiment of the people's will. Any law passed by Parliament or any action taken by the Executive that contravenes the provisions of the Constitution is legally void. The Supreme Court, as the guardian of the Constitution, is empowered to enforce this supremacy through its power of judicial review.
4.  **Basis of Representative Democracy:** This principle provides the foundation for the system of representative democracy outlined in the Constitution. The people exercise their power by electing their representatives to the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament), who then form the government and make laws on their behalf. The government is, therefore, accountable to the Parliament, and the Parliament is ultimately accountable to the people.

In essence, Article 7 establishes a clear chain of sovereignty: power originates from the people, is embodied in the Constitution, and is exercised by the organs of the state in accordance with that Constitution, making the people the ultimate masters of the Republic.

### **4. (a) Present the structure of local government in Bangladesh.**

The structure of local government in Bangladesh is constitutionally mandated (Article 59) and is designed to ensure popular participation in administration at the local level. The structure is bifurcated, with separate systems for rural and urban areas.

**I. Rural Local Government Structure:**
The rural system is a three-tiered structure, although currently, only two tiers are fully functional.
1.  **Zila Parishad (District Council):** This is the highest tier of rural local government, established at the district level. It is composed of an elected Chairman, members elected from the constituent Upazilas and Municipalities, and reserved members for women. Its primary role is to coordinate development activities among the various local government bodies within the district and to oversee district-level development projects.
2.  **Upazila Parishad (Sub-district Council):** This is the crucial middle tier, located at the sub-district (Upazila) level. It is a powerful body composed of an elected Chairman, a Vice-Chairman, and a Woman Vice-Chairman. The Chairmen of the Union Parishads within the Upazila are also members. The Upazila Parishad is responsible for planning, implementing, and monitoring a wide range of local development projects in areas like agriculture, education, health, and infrastructure.
3.  **Union Parishad (Union Council):** This is the oldest and most fundamental tier of local government, operating at the grassroots union level (a collection of villages). It is composed of a directly elected Chairman and nine members elected from nine wards, plus three women members elected to reserved seats. The Union Parishad is the first point of contact between the government and the rural populace, responsible for local law and order, vital registrations (births/deaths), infrastructure maintenance, and implementing local development and social safety net programs.

**II. Urban Local Government Structure:**
The urban system is primarily two-tiered, based on the size and importance of the urban area.
1.  **City Corporation (Mahanagar Palika):** This is the form of local government for the country's largest metropolitan areas, such as Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, and Rajshahi. A City Corporation is headed by a directly elected Mayor and is composed of directly elected Ward Councilors and women Councilors in reserved seats. It is responsible for providing a wide range of civic services, including water supply, waste management, road maintenance, public health, and urban planning for a large urban population.
2.  **Paurashava (Municipality):** This is the form of local government for smaller cities and towns. It is also headed by a directly elected Mayor and is composed of elected Ward Councilors and women Councilors. Its functions are similar to a City Corporation but on a smaller scale, tailored to the needs of a municipal town.

This dual structure ensures that local governance is tailored to the distinct needs and characteristics of both rural and urban communities in Bangladesh.

### **4. (b) Describe the Local Government (Paurashava) Election Rules, 2015.**

The Local Government (Paurashava) Election Rules, 2015, provide the detailed legal and procedural framework for conducting elections to the office of Mayor and Councilor in the municipalities (Paurashavas) of Bangladesh. These rules are formulated under the authority of the Local Government (Paurashava) Act, 2009.

The key provisions of the 2015 rules can be described as follows:

1.  **Conduct of Election on Party Lines:** A major change introduced by these rules and the corresponding amendment to the Act was the conduct of the mayoral election on a **party-political basis**. This means candidates for the post of Mayor are nominated by registered political parties and contest the election using their party's symbol. The election for Councilor positions, however, remains non-partisan.
2.  **Role of the Election Commission:** The rules reaffirm the supreme authority of the Election Commission (EC) to superintend, direct, and control the entire election process. The EC appoints Returning Officers and Assistant Returning Officers to conduct the elections at the local level.
3.  **Election Schedule and Process:** The rules outline the entire electoral timeline and process, including:
    *   The announcement of the election schedule by the EC.
    *   The submission of nomination papers by candidates.
    *   The scrutiny of nominations by the Returning Officer.
    *   The withdrawal of candidature.
    *   The allocation of election symbols (party symbols for mayors, and EC-designated symbols for councilors).
    *   The date of polling.
4.  **Candidate Qualifications and Disqualifications:** The rules specify the criteria for eligibility to contest the election (e.g., being a citizen of Bangladesh, being a registered voter in the Paurashava) and the grounds for disqualification (e.g., being of unsound mind, being a loan defaulter, having been convicted of a criminal offense involving moral turpitude).
5.  **Electoral Code of Conduct:** The rules provide for a strict Code of Conduct that all candidates and political parties must abide by during the campaign period. This includes regulations on:
    *   The maximum limit for election expenditure.
    *   Prohibitions on using government resources or transport for campaigning.
    *   Restrictions on the size and nature of election meetings, processions, and campaign materials (posters, banners).
    *   Prohibitions against any form of intimidation, violence, or statements that incite religious or communal hatred.
6.  **Polling and Counting:** The rules detail the procedures for setting up polling stations, the process of casting votes (using ballot papers or Electronic Voting Machines - EVMs), the counting of votes in the presence of candidates' agents, and the declaration of results by the Returning Officer.

In essence, the Paurashava Election Rules, 2015, provide the comprehensive operational blueprint for ensuring that municipal elections are conducted in a structured, transparent, and fair manner.

### **4. (c) Discuss the "Chittagong Hill Tracts District Local Government Councils".**

The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) District Local Government Councils are a unique and specialized system of local governance established for the three hill districts of Rangamati, Khagrachhari, and Bandarban. This system was created as a result of the historic **CHT Peace Accord of 1997**, which was signed between the Government of Bangladesh and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) to end decades of insurgency and address the political and land rights issues of the region's indigenous (Jumma) peoples.

These councils are fundamentally different from the Zila Parishads in the rest of the country. Their key features and importance are:

1.  **Specialized Structure and Composition:** Each of the three hill districts has its own District Council (e.g., Rangamati Hill District Council). The composition of these councils is designed to ensure the representation and preserve the dominance of the indigenous communities. The Chairman of the council must be an indigenous person. The membership is allocated based on a specific ratio between different indigenous ethnic groups and the non-indigenous (Bengali) population of that district.
2.  **Enhanced Powers and Functions:** The CHT District Councils are vested with a significantly greater degree of administrative and financial autonomy compared to their counterparts in the plains. They have been given jurisdiction and authority over **33 specific subjects** or departments at the district level. These include critical areas such as:
    *   Supervision of local police.
    *   Primary education.
    *   Local health and family welfare.
    *   Agriculture and forestry (excluding reserved forests).
    *   **Land management:** This is the most crucial and sensitive power, as the councils are supposed to have authority over the transfer and settlement of land, a key demand of the indigenous people.
3.  **Advisory Role and Coordination:** The councils have the power to advise the central government on matters relating to the CHT. They also coordinate development activities undertaken by various government and non-government organizations within their respective districts.
4.  **The CHT Regional Council:** Above the three district councils is a coordinating apex body, the **Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council**, whose chairman must also be an indigenous person. Its role is to supervise and coordinate the functions of the three district councils and the general administration of the region.

**Discussion:**
The establishment of these councils was a landmark step towards granting political and administrative autonomy to the CHT region. They represent a unique model of devolved governance within the unitary structure of Bangladesh, designed to protect the rights and preserve the distinct cultural identity of the indigenous peoples. However, the full implementation of the Peace Accord and the complete transfer of all 33 subjects (especially police and land management) to the councils remain ongoing challenges. The effectiveness of these councils in fulfilling the aspirations of the hill people is contingent upon their full empowerment in accordance with the spirit of the 1997 Accord.

### **4. (d) Review the "Union Parishad Election-2016".**

The Union Parishad (UP) Election of 2016 was a significant event in the political landscape of Bangladesh, primarily because it was the **first time in the country's history that the election for the post of UP Chairman was held on a party-political basis**. This marked a fundamental departure from the traditionally non-partisan nature of grassroots local government elections.

A review of the 2016 UP elections reveals several key aspects:

**1. Introduction of Party-Based Elections:**
The most significant feature was that candidates for the post of Chairman were nominated by registered political parties and contested the election using their party's official symbol (e.g., the boat for Awami League, the sheaf of paddy for BNP). The election for general members and women members in reserved seats remained non-partisan. The stated rationale for this change was to bring more transparency and accountability to the process, as parties were already informally involved in previous elections.

**2. Widespread Uncontested Victories:**
A prominent and concerning feature of the election was the unusually high number of candidates, predominantly from the ruling Awami League, who were elected as chairmen uncontested. This phenomenon raised serious questions about the competitiveness of the election and led to allegations from opposition parties and civil society that their potential candidates had been intimidated or obstructed from filing nomination papers.

**3. Election Violence and Irregularities:**
The election was marred by widespread violence, irregularities, and clashes between the supporters of rival candidates, both between different parties and among rival factions within the same party. There were numerous reports of ballot box stuffing, forceful occupation of polling centers, and other forms of electoral malpractice. This led to a significant number of deaths and injuries, casting a dark shadow over the electoral process.

**4. Role of the Election Commission:**
The Election Commission faced considerable criticism for its perceived failure to curb the violence and ensure a level playing field for all contestants. While the EC took action in some instances by postponing or cancelling elections in certain centers, many observers felt that these measures were insufficient to address the scale of the irregularities.

**5. Impact on Local Governance:**
The introduction of partisan politics at the grassroots level has had a mixed and debated impact. Proponents argue that it formalizes political realities. Critics, however, contend that it has intensified political polarization and rivalry in rural communities, undermined the tradition of local consensus-building, and made local government bodies more subservient to the directives of the central party leadership, thereby eroding their autonomy.

In conclusion, the 2016 Union Parishad election was a watershed moment that fundamentally altered the nature of grassroots politics in Bangladesh. While it was an attempt to formalize the role of political parties, it was widely criticized for the high levels of violence, irregularities, and the phenomenon of uncontested elections, raising significant concerns about its impact on the health of local democracy.

### **5. (a) Describe the importance of the Instrument of Surrender of the Pakistani forces on 16th December 1971. Who signed the said instrument on behalf of the Pakistani and Indian forces, and who was present on behalf of the Mukti Bahini?**

The Instrument of Surrender, signed on December 16, 1971, is a document of profound historical importance for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. It marks the formal end of the Bangladesh Liberation War and the definitive birth of an independent and sovereign Bangladesh.

**Importance of the Instrument of Surrender:**

1.  **Formal End of the Liberation War and Genocide:** The surrender marked the conclusive military victory of the allied forces and the end of the nine-month-long war, which had been characterized by a brutal genocide perpetrated by the Pakistan Army. It brought an immediate halt to the bloodshed and suffering.
2.  **Birth of an Independent Bangladesh:** The document is the legal and military testament to the creation of Bangladesh. The surrender of the Pakistan Eastern Command signified the collapse of Pakistani authority over its former eastern wing and the establishment of the new People's Republic of Bangladesh as a reality on the world map.
3.  **Largest Military Surrender Since WWII:** The surrender of over 93,000 Pakistani military and paramilitary personnel was one of the largest military surrenders in history since the Second World War. It was a decisive and humiliating military defeat for Pakistan and a moment of immense triumph and pride for the Bangladeshi and Indian forces.
4.  **Vindication of the Bengali Struggle:** The public ceremony at the Ramna Race Course (now Suhrawardy Udyan)—the very place where Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had delivered his historic 7th March speech calling for the struggle for liberation—was deeply symbolic. The surrender at this location represented the ultimate vindication of the Bengali people's long and arduous struggle for freedom and self-determination.

**Signatories and Presence:**

*   **On behalf of the Pakistan Eastern Command:** The instrument was signed by **Lieutenant-General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi**, the Commander of the Pakistan Army in East Pakistan.
*   **On behalf of the Indian and Bangladesh Forces (as the Joint Command):** The surrender was accepted and signed by **Lieutenant-General Jagjit Singh Aurora**, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army.

*   **Present on behalf of the Mukti Bahini:** The senior representative of the Mukti Bahini present at the ceremony was **Group Captain A. K. Khandker**, who was the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Bangladesh Armed Forces. His presence was crucial as it symbolized the central role and sacrifice of the Bangladeshi freedom fighters in achieving their own liberation.

### **5. (b) Discuss the "Homecoming Day of Bangabandhu".**

The "Homecoming Day of Bangabandhu" refers to **January 10, 1972**, the day the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, returned to a newly independent Bangladesh after more than nine months of imprisonment in a Pakistani jail. This day is observed with great reverence and emotion in Bangladesh, as it is considered the day that the victory of the Liberation War achieved its "fullness" or "completeness."

**Discussion of its Significance:**

1.  **The Return of the Nation's Symbol:** Bangabandhu was the supreme leader and the central inspiration behind the Liberation War. Throughout the nine-month struggle, his name was the rallying cry for the freedom fighters and the people. His return from what was feared to be certain death was a moment of immense joy, relief, and national jubilation. His physical presence on the soil of the independent nation he had founded was seen as the final, triumphant act of the liberation saga.
2.  **Filling the Leadership Vacuum:** In the immediate aftermath of the war, the new nation faced monumental challenges: a shattered economy, destroyed infrastructure, and the need to rehabilitate millions of refugees. The provisional Mujibnagar Government had led the war admirably, but the charismatic and undisputed leadership of Bangabandhu was essential to unite the nation, provide a clear direction for reconstruction, and consolidate the new state's authority.
3.  **The Homecoming Speech:** Upon his return, Bangabandhu addressed a massive, emotional crowd at the historic Ramna Race Course. In his speech, he laid out the foundational principles and the future path for the new nation. He spoke of building a secular, democratic, and socialist state (a "Sonar Bangla" or Golden Bengal), outlined the new country's foreign policy ("Friendship to all, malice towards none"), and called upon the people to unite in the colossal task of nation-building. This speech provided the moral and political compass for the new government.
4.  **Securing International Recognition:** Bangabandhu's journey back to Bangladesh was also a major diplomatic event. He was first released to London, where he held a press conference that garnered global attention, and then he flew to Dhaka via New Delhi, where he was warmly received by the Indian leadership. This journey helped to accelerate the process of international recognition for the new state of Bangladesh.

In essence, Bangabandhu's Homecoming Day is not just the commemoration of a leader's return. It symbolizes the return of the nation's soul and the true beginning of the arduous but hopeful journey of building an independent Bangladesh from the ruins of war.

### **5. (c) Review the process of withdrawal of the Indian army from independent Bangladesh.**

The withdrawal of the Indian army from independent Bangladesh in early 1972 stands as a remarkable and almost unique event in modern military history. It was a swift, complete, and voluntary withdrawal, which solidified the friendly relations between the two countries and demonstrated India's respect for Bangladesh's sovereignty.

**Background:**
The Indian army had entered Bangladesh as part of a formal "Joint Command" with the Bangladeshi Mukti Bahini on December 3, 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on India. Their joint military campaign led to the swift surrender of the Pakistani forces on December 16, 1971. In the immediate aftermath, Indian troops remained in Bangladesh to help restore law and order, disarm various armed groups, and secure the surrender of Pakistani soldiers across the country.

**The Withdrawal Process:**

1.  **A Decision Based on Mutual Agreement:** The decision for the withdrawal was not a unilateral one but was based on a clear understanding between the leadership of the two countries. Upon his return to Bangladesh on January 10, 1972, one of the first and most important issues Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman discussed with the Indian leadership was the withdrawal of their troops. He firmly believed that the presence of any foreign army on Bangladeshi soil was incompatible with the country's newly won sovereignty.
2.  **Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Commitment:** The Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, readily agreed to Bangabandhu's request. She respected Bangladesh's sovereign status and had no intention of allowing the Indian army to become an occupying force. This prompt agreement was a testament to the strong personal rapport between the two leaders and India's genuine goodwill towards the new nation.
3.  **Swift and Phased Withdrawal:** The withdrawal process began very quickly. A joint statement issued during Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's visit to Dhaka in March 1972 formalized the decision. The withdrawal was carried out in a phased but rapid manner.
4.  **Completion of Withdrawal:** The final withdrawal of the Indian armed forces was completed by **March 12, 1972**, less than three months after the victory on December 16. The departure was marked by a farewell parade at the Dhaka stadium, where Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman officially thanked the Indian army for their contribution to Bangladesh's liberation.

**Review and Significance:**
The swift and complete withdrawal of the Indian army is highly significant because:
*   It **refuted the Pakistani propaganda** that India intended to annex or turn Bangladesh into a satellite state.
*   It **demonstrated India's respect** for Bangladesh's sovereignty and the principle of non-interference.
*   It **solidified the foundation of a strong and friendly relationship** between the two countries based on trust and mutual respect.
*   It stands in stark contrast to many other instances in history where a liberating army has overstayed its welcome and become an army of occupation. This act of statesmanship by both Bangabandhu and Indira Gandhi remains a high point in the history of South Asian diplomacy.

### **5. (d) Discuss the achievements of the present government in resolving the enclave problem.**

The resolution of the decades-old enclave (*chhitmahal*) problem stands as one of the most significant and historic diplomatic achievements of the present government of Bangladesh, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. This complex humanitarian and territorial issue, a lingering anomaly from the partition of British India in 1947, was successfully and peacefully resolved through the implementation of the **Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) of 1974**.

**The Problem:**
The problem involved 111 Indian enclaves inside Bangladeshi territory and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves inside Indian territory. The residents of these enclaves, numbering over 50,000 people, were effectively stateless. They were cut off from their respective mainlands and deprived of basic rights and government services like electricity, healthcare, education, and security for nearly seven decades.

**Achievements of the Government:**

1.  **Intensive and Successful Diplomacy:** The key achievement was the government's ability to successfully revive a long-dormant issue and pursue it with persistent and effective diplomacy. The government of Sheikh Hasina made the resolution of this humanitarian issue a top foreign policy priority. Through sustained high-level engagement with successive Indian governments (both the UPA and the NDA), it succeeded in building the political consensus within India needed to ratify the agreement.
2.  **Securing Unanimous Ratification in the Indian Parliament:** The crowning achievement of this diplomatic effort was securing the unanimous ratification of the LBA protocol by the Indian Parliament (both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha) in May 2015. This was a remarkable feat, as it required overcoming domestic political opposition within India.
3.  **Smooth and Peaceful Implementation:** Following the ratification, the government worked closely with its Indian counterparts to ensure a smooth and humane implementation of the agreement. This involved:
    *   Conducting a joint survey to give residents the choice of which nationality to adopt.
    *   Ensuring a peaceful and orderly exchange of territory at midnight on July 31, 2015.
    *   Granting citizenship and full constitutional rights to the nearly 37,000 enclave dwellers who chose to become Bangladeshi citizens.
4.  **Extending Governance and Development:** Immediately after the exchange, the government moved swiftly to extend state administration and development activities to the newly acquired territories. This included establishing schools, community clinics, roads, and electricity connections, and enrolling the new citizens in the national voter list, thereby ending their decades of statelessness and deprivation.

In conclusion, the resolution of the enclave problem is a landmark achievement. It represents a victory for humane diplomacy, a model for the peaceful settlement of complex border disputes, and a testament to the present government's commitment to securing the nation's territorial integrity and ensuring the rights and dignity of all its people.
Of course. Here are the detailed, essay-style answers for the remaining questions (6 and 7) from the "Bangladesh Affairs" examination paper, as requested.

***

### **6. (a) What are the main objectives of the Seventh Five-Year Plan?**

The Seventh Five-Year Plan (7FYP) of Bangladesh, covering the fiscal period from 2016 to 2020, was a strategic national development plan designed to accelerate the country's economic growth and social progress. It was formulated as the first of two five-year plans aimed at achieving the goals outlined in the government's long-term "Perspective Plan 2021" and transitioning Bangladesh to a middle-income country.

The main objectives of the Seventh Five-Year Plan were comprehensive and ambitious, centered on the theme of "Accelerating Growth, Empowering Citizens." The core objectives can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Accelerating Economic Growth:** The primary objective was to achieve a high and sustainable rate of economic growth. The plan targeted an average annual GDP growth rate of 7.4%, aiming to reach 8% by the final year of the plan (FY2020). This growth was envisioned to be driven by increased investment, industrialization, and export promotion.
2.  **Creation of Productive Employment:** The plan aimed not just for growth, but for inclusive growth that creates decent and productive jobs. A key objective was to create over 12.9 million new employment opportunities and to increase the share of formal sector employment.
3.  **Poverty Reduction and Inequality:** A central goal was to continue the country's successful trend of poverty reduction. The 7FYP aimed to reduce the poverty rate to 18.6% and the extreme poverty rate to 8.9% by 2020. It also emphasized reducing income and social inequality.
4.  **Human Resource Development:** The plan prioritized significant investment in human capital. This included objectives for improving the quality of education at all levels, enhancing technical and vocational training to create a skilled workforce, and improving health and nutrition outcomes for the population.
5.  **Infrastructure Development:** Recognizing infrastructure as a key bottleneck, the plan set ambitious targets for developing the country's physical infrastructure. This included major projects in the power and energy sector to ensure a reliable electricity supply, and developing transport infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railways, and ports.
6.  **Ensuring Environmental and Climate Resilience:** The 7FYP was one of the first national plans to fully integrate environmental sustainability and climate change considerations. Its objectives included promoting green growth, ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources, and implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.
7.  **Digitalization and Good Governance:** Continuing the "Digital Bangladesh" vision, the plan aimed to further leverage ICT to improve public service delivery and enhance governance. Objectives included strengthening public institutions, ensuring rule of law, and combating corruption.

### **6. (b) Review the development goals of the Bangladesh government by 2021.**

The development goals of the Bangladesh government for the year 2021 were encapsulated in a comprehensive and ambitious long-term strategic document known as **"Vision 2021"**. This vision was articulated to coincide with the 50th anniversary (golden jubilee) of Bangladesh's independence. Its overarching goal was to transform Bangladesh into a middle-income country characterized by social justice, reduced poverty, and technological advancement.

A review of these development goals reveals a holistic approach to national progress:

1.  **Achieving Middle-Income Country Status:** The foremost economic goal was to graduate from the World Bank's classification of a low-income country to a middle-income country. This required raising the per capita Gross National Income (GNI) to the specified threshold, which Bangladesh successfully achieved.
2.  **Poverty Eradication:** A central goal was to drastically reduce poverty. Vision 2021 aimed to bring down the poverty rate to around 13-15%, effectively lifting millions out of poverty and making significant strides towards eradicating extreme poverty.
3.  **Ensuring Energy and Food Security:** The vision set a target of achieving self-sufficiency in food production, which was largely met. A critical goal was also to ensure electricity for all citizens, which involved a massive expansion of power generation capacity through the construction of numerous new power plants.
4.  **Building a "Digital Bangladesh":** This was a flagship component of Vision 2021. The goal was to leverage Information and Communication Technology (ICT) across all sectors of society. This included establishing a robust nationwide internet infrastructure, digitizing government services (e-governance), promoting the IT industry, and creating a tech-savvy generation.
5.  **Human Development:** The goals included significant improvements in social indicators. This meant achieving universal primary education, reaching gender parity in education (which was successfully accomplished), further reducing maternal and child mortality rates, and increasing the average life expectancy.
6.  **Infrastructure Development:** Vision 2021 prioritized the implementation of several large-scale "mega-projects" considered crucial for economic transformation. These included the Padma Bridge, the Dhaka Metro Rail, the Karnaphuli Tunnel, and the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, among others.
7.  **Establishing Good Governance:** The vision also aimed to establish good governance by strengthening democratic institutions, ensuring the rule of law, combating corruption, and promoting a culture of transparency and accountability in public administration.

By the golden jubilee in 2021, Bangladesh had made remarkable progress towards these goals, particularly in achieving middle-income status, reducing poverty, ensuring food security, and in the realm of digitalization, marking a successful chapter in its development journey.

### **6. (c) What do you understand by the implementation of the Padma Bridge project?**

The implementation of the Padma Bridge project is arguably the most significant and iconic feat of engineering and national endeavor in the history of independent Bangladesh. To "understand" its implementation is to appreciate it not just as the construction of a bridge, but as a powerful symbol of the nation's economic rise, self-reliance, and sovereign capability.

The implementation can be understood through the following key aspects:

1.  **Overcoming the Financing Challenge:** The initial phase of the project was embroiled in a major controversy when the World Bank and other development partners withdrew their pledged funding in 2012 over allegations of corruption conspiracy. In a bold and historic decision, the government of Bangladesh, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, decided to implement this colossal project **entirely with the nation's own funds**. This decision was a turning point. It transformed the project from a mere infrastructure undertaking into a powerful statement of national pride and a rejection of dependency on foreign aid for critical national projects.
2.  **Engineering and Construction Marvel:** The implementation involved overcoming immense technical and engineering challenges. The Padma is one of the world's most mighty and unpredictable rivers, with a powerful current and a deep, shifting riverbed. The project required state-of-the-art engineering solutions, including the use of some of the world's longest steel piles driven deep into the riverbed to secure the foundations. The construction of the 6.15-kilometer-long, double-decker bridge (with a four-lane road on the top level and a single-track railway on the bottom) was a massive and complex logistical operation involving international contractors under the supervision of the Bangladesh Bridge Authority.
3.  **Socio-Economic Transformation:** The implementation of the project is understood through its transformative economic impact. The bridge has established direct road and rail connectivity between the capital, Dhaka, and the southwestern region of the country for the first time. This has drastically reduced travel time, facilitated trade and commerce, spurred industrialization in the previously disconnected southwest, and is projected to boost the country's GDP by over 1.2%.

In essence, understanding the implementation of the Padma Bridge project means recognizing it as a symbol of Bangladesh's national resolve, its growing economic capacity, its technical prowess, and its aspiration to build a prosperous future on its own terms.

### **6. (d) Review the potential and progress of the Metro Rail project.**

The Dhaka Metro Rail project is a landmark urban infrastructure project designed to address one of Dhaka's most intractable problems: crippling traffic congestion. A review of its potential and progress (as of the period the question was likely set) reveals it to be a project of immense transformative potential that has made significant, visible progress.

**Potential:**

1.  **Alleviating Traffic Congestion:** The primary potential of the Metro Rail is to provide a fast, reliable, and high-capacity public transport system that can significantly reduce the number of private cars and buses on Dhaka's choked streets. By offering a time-efficient alternative, it aims to drastically cut down the chronic traffic jams that cost the economy billions of dollars in lost productivity and fuel annually.
2.  **Economic Benefits:** The potential economic benefits are vast. Faster commute times will boost labor productivity. The areas around the metro stations are expected to develop into new commercial and residential hubs (a process known as transit-oriented development), stimulating economic activity and creating jobs.
3.  **Environmental Benefits:** By encouraging a shift from private vehicles to mass transit, the Metro Rail has the potential to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in one of the world's most polluted cities.
4.  **Modernizing the Urban Landscape:** The project is a symbol of urban modernization. It introduces a modern, disciplined, and efficient transport culture and is expected to improve the overall quality of life for the city's residents.

**Progress:**

As of the relevant period, the project, particularly its first phase (MRT Line-6, running from Uttara to Motijheel), had made substantial and visible progress.
*   **Physical Construction:** The construction of the viaducts (the elevated tracks) and the metro stations along the Uttara to Agargaon stretch was largely complete, with other sections showing rapid progress.
*   **Procurement and Testing:** The metro train sets had been procured from Japan, and test runs were being conducted on the completed sections of the track. This indicated that the project was moving from the construction phase towards the operational phase.
*   **Public Visibility:** The visible progress of the elevated structures and the trial runs of the trains generated significant public excitement and anticipation, showcasing the project's steady advancement towards its launch.

In conclusion, the Dhaka Metro Rail project holds immense potential to revolutionize Dhaka's transport system and improve its economic and environmental health. The steady and visible progress in its construction has demonstrated the government's capacity to implement complex, large-scale urban infrastructure projects, making it a beacon of hope for a more livable and functional megacity.

### **7. What are 5 notable steps taken by the present government for women's empowerment?**

The present government of Bangladesh, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has made women's empowerment a central pillar of its national development strategy. This commitment has been translated into a series of notable and impactful policy actions. Five of the most significant steps are:

1.  **Expanding Educational Opportunities and Stipends for Girls:** The government has made a concerted effort to ensure girls' access to education. It has not only provided free primary education but has also implemented a highly successful nationwide stipend program for female students at the secondary and higher secondary levels. This financial incentive has dramatically increased girls' enrollment, reduced dropout rates, prevented child marriage, and achieved gender parity in education, which is a foundational step for all other forms of empowerment.
2.  **Maternity Leave and Childcare Support:** A landmark step for working women was the extension of maternity leave for government employees to **six months with full pay**. This policy allows mothers crucial time for post-natal recovery and to care for their newborns without jeopardizing their careers. The government has also promoted the establishment of daycare centers and childcare facilities in both public and private sector workplaces to support working mothers.
3.  **Ensuring Political Representation at All Levels:** The government has actively strengthened mechanisms for women's political empowerment. It has maintained and expanded the system of **reserved seats for women** in the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament) and, crucially, in all tiers of local government (Union Parishads, Upazila Parishads, Paurashavas, and City Corporations). This has ensured the direct participation of thousands of women in political decision-making from the grassroots to the national level.
4.  **Promoting Women's Economic Participation and Entrepreneurship:** Beyond creating mass employment in the RMG sector, the government has taken specific steps to promote female entrepreneurship. This includes providing access to collateral-free loans for women entrepreneurs through state-owned banks and specialized financial institutions, offering training in various trades through government vocational centers, and reserving portions of public markets for women vendors.
5.  **Strengthening Legal and Institutional Frameworks:** The government has enacted and strengthened several laws to protect women from violence and discrimination. This includes the **Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2010**, and the **Human Trafficking (Deterrence and Suppression) Act, 2012**. Furthermore, it has established a nationwide network of "One-Stop Crisis Centers" in government hospitals to provide integrated medical, legal, and psychological support to female victims of violence.
