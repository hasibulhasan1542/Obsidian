#### **(b) Which districts comprise the Barind Tract?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
The Barind Tract (Barendra Bhumi) is one of the major physiographic units of Bangladesh, representing an elevated **Pleistocene-era terrace**. This region is characterized by its reddish and greyish old alluvial soil, which is relatively less fertile compared to the surrounding floodplains.

The Barind Tract is primarily composed of districts in the northwestern part of Bangladesh, spanning across the Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. The main districts are:
*   **Rajshahi Division:** The majority of **Naogaon**, **Rajshahi**, and **Chapainawabganj** districts, along with parts of **Natore**.
*   **Rangpur Division:** Parts of **Joypurhat**, **Rangpur**, and **Dinajpur** districts.

Covering a total area of approximately **9,320 square kilometers**, this region is higher in elevation than the adjacent floodplains and has historically been somewhat drought-prone, though modern irrigation has transformed it into a significant agricultural zone.

---
#### **(c) Describe the topographical features of different areas of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
The topography of Bangladesh can be broadly classified into three distinct categories, each with unique features:

**1. Tertiary Hills (Comprising about 12% of the total land area):**
These hills were formed during the Tertiary period when the Himalayas were uplifted. They are composed of soft, sedimentary rocks like sandstone, shale, and clay.
*   **The Southeastern Hills:** Located in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (Rangamati, Bandarban, Khagrachhari districts) and Cox's Bazar. These hills are higher and form a series of parallel ranges running north to south. The average elevation is about 610 meters. This region contains Bangladesh's highest peaks, including **Tazing Dong (Bijoy)** at approximately 1,231 meters.
*   **The Northeastern Hills:** Located in the northern and eastern parts of the Sylhet Division (e.g., Moulvibazar, Habiganj) and bordering areas of Mymensingh and Netrokona. These are much lower in height, often referred to as 'tilas' (hillocks), with an average elevation not exceeding 244 meters.

**2. Pleistocene Terraces (Comprising about 8% of the total land area):**
These are elevated landmasses of older alluvium, formed during the Pleistocene epoch (approx. 25,000 years ago). They stand higher than the surrounding floodplains.
*   **The Barind Tract:** Located in the northwest (Rajshahi & Rangpur divisions), it is the largest of the terraces, covering about 9,320 sq. km.
*   **The Madhupur and Bhawal Garh:** Located in the central region, covering parts of Tangail, Gazipur, and Mymensingh districts, with a total area of about 4,103 sq. km.
*   **The Lalmai Hills:** A small, low hill range west of Cumilla, about 8 km long, with an area of approximately 34 sq. km.

**3. Recent Floodplains (Comprising about 80% of the total land area):**
This is the largest and most dominant topographical feature, formed by the silt deposited by the vast river network of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) system. This vast, flat, and fertile plain is the heartland of Bangladesh's agriculture. Key sub-regions include:
*   **The Piedmont Plain:** At the foothills of the Himalayas in the northwest (Rangpur, Dinajpur).
*   **The Floodplains:** The central plains formed by the Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna rivers, subject to annual flooding and silt deposition.
*   **The Deltaic Plain:** The southern part of Bangladesh forms the world's largest delta. It is a complex landscape of rivers, distributaries, and tidal channels.
*   **The Coastal Plain:** The southernmost strip along the Bay of Bengal, heavily influenced by tides. This area includes the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest.

### **Question 02**

#### **(a) What is a population census?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
A **population census** is the total process of collecting, compiling, evaluating, analyzing, and publishing or otherwise disseminating demographic, economic, and social data pertaining, at a specified time, to all persons in a country or a well-delineated part of a country. It is a comprehensive national undertaking to create a complete snapshot of a country's population.

The essential features of a population census are:
1.  **Individual Enumeration:** Information is collected separately for each individual.
2.  **Universality:** The census covers a precisely defined territory and aims to include every person present or residing within its scope, without omission or duplication.
3.  **Simultaneity:** It refers to a single point in time (the "census moment"), ensuring that the data collected is comparable and reflects the population at that specific moment.
4.  **Defined Periodicity:** Censuses are conducted at regular intervals, typically every **10 years**, to allow for the comparison of data and the study of population trends over time.

In Bangladesh, the national statistical agency responsible for conducting the census is the **Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)**. The most recent one, the **6th Population and Housing Census**, was conducted in 2022.

It ensures uninterrupted telecommunication services, especially during natural disasters, and supports DTH (Direct-to-Home) TV services, VSAT, and other digital connectivity.~~

---
#### **(d) Food Security**

**Answer:**
**Food Security**, as defined by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. It is built on four pillars:

1.  **Availability:** The physical existence of sufficient quantities of food, whether from domestic production or imports.
2.  **Access:** People's ability to obtain appropriate foods, which depends on their economic and physical access.
3.  **Utilization:** The proper biological use of food, requiring a diet providing sufficient energy and essential nutrients, potable water, and adequate sanitation. It also relates to knowledge of basic nutrition.
4.  **Stability:** Ensuring access to adequate food at all times, without losing access due to sudden shocks (e.g., economic crisis, climate events).

Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in food security, achieving self-sufficiency in rice production. The government runs extensive social safety net programs like the Open Market Sale (OMS) and Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) to ensure access for the poor. However, challenges remain in ensuring nutritional security, food diversity, and maintaining stability in the face of climate change.

#### **(e) Information and Communication Technology (ICT)**

**Answer:**
**Information and Communication Technology (ICT)** is an umbrella term that includes any communication device or application, encompassing computers, network hardware, software, and the Internet. It refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications, focusing on communication technologies such as the internet, wireless networks, cell phones, and other communication mediums.

In Bangladesh, ICT has been the cornerstone of the **"Digital Bangladesh"** vision, a key component of the government's development strategy. Its impact has been transformative:
*   **E-Governance:** The implementation of e-services has improved public service delivery, increased transparency, and reduced corruption. Examples include e-tendering, online tax payment, and digital birth registration.
*   **Economic Growth:** ICT has created new economic opportunities through the booming IT outsourcing and freelancing industry. **Mobile Financial Services (MFS)** like bKash and Nagad have revolutionized financial inclusion.
*   **Human Development:** It has expanded access to education through online learning platforms and to healthcare via telemedicine services, especially in rural areas.
*   **Connectivity:** The expansion of internet connectivity and mobile networks has connected millions, bridging the digital divide and empowering citizens with information.

ICT is no longer just a sector but an essential enabler of socio-economic development across all spheres of life in Bangladesh.

Of course. Here are the detailed, data-rich answers for the remaining questions from the "Bangladesh Affairs" paper.

### **Question 04**

#### **(a) Describe the current environmental and nature-related challenges of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**

Bangladesh, due to its unique deltaic geography and high population density, faces a multitude of severe environmental and nature-related challenges that threaten its development, livelihoods, and ecosystems.

1.  **Climate Change Vulnerability:** Bangladesh is consistently ranked as one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. Key challenges include:
    *   **Sea-Level Rise:** With a low-lying coastal belt, a one-meter rise in sea level is projected to inundate about 18% of the country's land, displacing over 20 million people and causing massive land loss and soil salinity.
    *   **Extreme Weather Events:** The frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones (like Sidr and Aila), storm surges, and riverine floods are increasing, causing immense damage to life, property, and infrastructure.
    *   **Drought and Water Scarcity:** Erratic rainfall patterns are leading to increased drought, particularly in the northern Barind Tract, impacting agriculture and drinking water supplies.

2.  **Water Pollution:** Surface and groundwater sources are heavily polluted.
    *   **Industrial Pollution:** Untreated industrial effluent from the textile, tannery, and pharmaceutical industries is discharged directly into rivers like the Buriganga, Shitalakshya, and Karnaphuli, rendering them biologically dead in stretches.
    *   **Arsenic Contamination:** Naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater, affecting an estimated 35 to 77 million people, remains one of the world's largest mass poisoning events and a major public health crisis.
    *   **Agricultural Runoff:** The excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides pollutes water bodies through agricultural runoff, leading to eutrophication.

3.  **Deforestation and Biodiversity Loss:** The country's forest coverage is critically low (around 17% according to official figures, but much lower for actual canopy cover). Deforestation, driven by population pressure, illegal logging, and land grabbing, leads to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and disruption of ecosystems like the Sundarbans and the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

4.  **Air Pollution:** Dhaka consistently ranks among the most polluted cities in the world. The primary sources are emissions from brick kilns, vehicles, construction dust, and transboundary smog, leading to severe respiratory and other public health issues.

5.  **Land Degradation and River Erosion:** Being a riverine country, bank erosion is a constant threat, displacing hundreds of thousands of people annually. Soil quality is also degrading due to intensive farming, overuse of chemicals, and increasing salinity in coastal areas.

These interconnected challenges pose a significant threat to Bangladesh's long-term sustainability and require urgent, integrated policy interventions.

### **Question 06**

#### **(a) What are the mega projects of Bangladesh undertaken by the present government?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

The present government of Bangladesh has undertaken several transformative **Mega Projects** as part of its strategy to accelerate economic growth, modernize infrastructure, and achieve the goals of Vision 2041. These large-scale, high-investment projects are designed to create a paradigm shift in the country's connectivity and industrial capacity.

The most prominent mega projects include:
1.  **Padma Multipurpose Bridge:** The 6.15 km long road-rail bridge connecting the southwestern region with the capital, Dhaka. It was inaugurated in June 2022 and built entirely with domestic funding.
2.  **Dhaka Metro Rail (MRT Line-6):** An elevated mass rapid transit system designed to ease traffic congestion in Dhaka. The first phase from Uttara to Agargaon was inaugurated in December 2022.
3.  **Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant:** A 2,400 MW nuclear power plant being built in Pabna with Russian technical assistance, aimed at ensuring the country's long-term energy security.
4.  **Karnaphuli River Tunnel (Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel):** The first underwater tunnel in South Asia, connecting the two banks of the Karnaphuli river in Chattogram to boost connectivity and trade.
5.  **Payra Deep Sea Port:** A new deep-sea port being developed in Patuakhali to handle large container ships and reduce pressure on the existing ports of Chattogram and Mongla.
6.  **Matarbari Coal-Fired Power Plant and Deep Sea Port:** A 1,200 MW ultra-supercritical coal power plant in Cox's Bazar, coupled with a deep-sea port facility, financed by Japan.
7.  **Dhaka Elevated Expressway:** A major expressway aimed at providing a fast, signal-free corridor through the congested capital city.
8.  **Dohazari-Cox's Bazar-Gundum Rail Line:** A project to connect the tourist hub of Cox's Bazar with the national railway network.

### **Question 07**

#### **(a) Describe the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the economy of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**

The Russia-Ukraine war, although geographically distant, has had significant and multifaceted negative impacts on the economy of Bangladesh, primarily through its disruption of global supply chains and commodity markets.

1.  **Inflationary Pressure and Import Costs:** The war caused a sharp spike in global prices for energy, food, and industrial raw materials.
    *   **Fuel Prices:** As a net energy importer, Bangladesh was hit hard by the surge in global oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices. The government was forced to raise domestic fuel prices significantly in August 2022, which had a cascading effect on transportation costs and overall inflation, pushing it to a decade high of over 9%.
    *   **Food and Fertilizer:** Both Russia and Ukraine are major global suppliers of wheat and fertilizer. The disruption in supply led to higher import costs for these essential commodities, impacting food security and agricultural production costs in Bangladesh.

2.  **Pressure on Foreign Exchange Reserves:** The ballooning import bill, driven by high commodity prices, put immense pressure on Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves. Reserves fell from a peak of over $48 billion in 2021 to below $20 billion (by BPM6 calculation) in 2023, creating challenges in financing imports and maintaining currency stability. This led to a significant depreciation of the Taka against the US dollar.

3.  **Impact on Exports:**
    *   **European Markets:** The war-induced economic slowdown and high inflation in Europe, which is the largest market for Bangladesh's Ready-Made Garments (RMG), led to a slump in demand and a slowdown in export growth.
    *   **Russian Market:** Russia was an emerging market for Bangladeshi exports. Direct trade was disrupted due to sanctions on Russian banks and the exclusion from the SWIFT system.

4.  **Challenges for Power Sector and Mega Projects:**
    *   The high cost of imported LNG forced the government to scale back electricity generation from gas-fired power plants, leading to power shortages (load shedding).
    *   The Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant project, being built with Russian financing and technology, faced logistical and payment challenges due to the international sanctions imposed on Russia.

In summary, the Russia-Ukraine war has impacted Bangladesh's economy by triggering high inflation, depleting foreign reserves, straining the energy sector, and creating uncertainty for its export-oriented growth model.

### **Question 08**

#### **(a) What is the importance of holding elections for establishing democracy?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

Holding regular, free, and fair elections is the cornerstone of establishing and sustaining a democratic system of government. Its importance is fundamental for several reasons:

1.  **Expression of Popular Sovereignty:** Elections are the primary mechanism through which the ultimate power of the state—sovereignty—is vested in and exercised by the people. Citizens choose their representatives to govern on their behalf, making the government a reflection of the popular will.
2.  **Legitimacy of Government:** A government that comes to power through a credible electoral process enjoys both domestic and international legitimacy. This legitimacy is crucial for its ability to govern effectively, command the respect of its citizens, and engage with the international community.
3.  **Peaceful Transfer of Power:** Elections provide a structured, predictable, and peaceful mechanism for the transfer of political power from one group of leaders to another. This prevents the instability, violence, and chaos that often accompany power struggles in non-democratic systems.
4.  **Accountability of Rulers:** The periodic nature of elections ensures that rulers are accountable to the people they govern. If citizens are dissatisfied with the performance of their elected representatives, they have the power to remove them from office in the next election. This creates a powerful incentive for governments to be responsive to public needs and opinions.
5.  **Political Participation and Inclusion:** Elections encourage political participation by giving every eligible citizen a voice in the political process. They provide a platform for diverse political parties and candidates to present their ideas and compete for public support, ensuring a degree of political inclusion and representation.

In essence, elections are the institutional lifeblood of a democracy, providing the means for representation, accountability, legitimacy, and the peaceful arbitration of political power.

Of course. Here are the detailed, data-rich answers for the final set of questions from the "Bangladesh Affairs" paper.

***

### **Question 05**

#### **(a) What are the fundamental principles of state policy as described in the Constitution of Bangladesh?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**

The fundamental principles of state policy are outlined in **Part II (Articles 8-25)** of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. These principles are intended to be a guide for the state in making laws and governing the country, representing the core ideals and long-term goals of the nation.

As per **Article 8**, the four fundamental principles are:
1.  **Nationalism:** The unity and solidarity of the Bengali nation, which was forged during the struggle for independence, shall be the basis of Bengali nationalism.
2.  **Socialism:** The Constitution aims to establish a society free from exploitation—a socialist society—through democratic means, to ensure social justice and equitable distribution of wealth.
3.  **Democracy:** The Republic shall be a democracy where fundamental human rights and freedoms are guaranteed, and where all citizens participate in administration at all levels through their elected representatives.
4.  **Secularism:** The state will ensure the elimination of communalism in all its forms, will not grant political status to any religion, will not discriminate against any person on the grounds of religion, and will prevent the abuse of religion for political purposes.

While these principles are fundamental to the governance of Bangladesh, **Article 8(2)** states that they "shall not be judicially enforceable." This means that a citizen cannot sue the government in court for failing to implement these principles, but they serve as the moral and political compass for the state's actions.

---
#### **(c) Discuss the local government system of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**

The local government system of Bangladesh is a tiered structure designed to decentralize administration and ensure public participation at the grassroots level, as mandated by **Article 59 and 60** of the Constitution. The system is broadly divided into rural and urban local government bodies.

**1. Rural Local Government:**
The rural system is a three-tiered structure:
*   **Zila Parishad (District Council):** This is the highest tier at the district level. It is composed of an elected Chairman, members, and reserved-seat female members. Its primary functions include overseeing and coordinating the development activities of all upazilas and union parishads within the district, and implementing district-level development projects.
*   **Upazila Parishad (Sub-district Council):** This is the crucial middle tier. It consists of an elected Chairman, a Vice-Chairman, and a female Vice-Chairman. Its role is to prepare and implement five-year development plans for the upazila, coordinate the functions of different government departments at the local level, and supervise the activities of the Union Parishads.
*   **Union Parishad (Union Council):** This is the oldest and most fundamental tier of local government, serving a collection of villages. Led by an elected Chairman and members (including reserved seats for women), its functions are vast, ranging from local infrastructure development (roads, culverts), sanitation, and water supply to arbitrating local disputes, issuing certificates, and assisting in the implementation of national government programs.

**2. Urban Local Government:**
The urban system is structured based on the size and importance of the urban area:
*   **City Corporations:** These are established for the largest metropolitan cities in the country. Currently, there are **12 City Corporations** (e.g., Dhaka North, Dhaka South, Chattogram, Rajshahi). They are headed by an elected Mayor and supported by Ward Councilors. Their responsibilities include urban planning, waste management, public health, maintenance of roads and drainage, and providing various civic amenities to the city dwellers.
*   **Paurashava (Municipality):** These are established for smaller towns and urban centers. They are categorized into Class A, B, and C based on their revenue and population. Headed by a Mayor and Councilors, their functions are similar to those of City Corporations but on a smaller scale.

**Key Features and Challenges:**
The system is designed to promote local democracy and development. However, it faces challenges such as a lack of financial autonomy (heavy dependence on central government grants), limited administrative authority over government officials posted at the local level, and occasional political interference, which can hinder its effectiveness.

---
### **Question 08**

#### **(c) Describe the responsibilities of the Election Commission as stated in the Constitution of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**

The establishment and responsibilities of the Election Commission (EC) of Bangladesh are enshrined in **Part VII (Elections), Articles 118-126**, of the Constitution. The EC is an independent constitutional body tasked with the fundamental duty of ensuring free, fair, and credible elections.

According to **Article 119(1)**, the responsibilities of the Election Commission are:
1.  **Superintendence, Direction, and Control of Elections:** The EC has the supreme authority over all aspects of the electoral process. Its key responsibilities include:
    *   Holding elections to the office of the **President**.
    *   Holding elections for the members of **Parliament (Jatiya Sangsad)**.
2.  **Preparation of Electoral Rolls:** The Commission is responsible for preparing and periodically updating the electoral rolls (voter lists) for the presidential and parliamentary elections. This ensures that all eligible citizens have the right to vote.
3.  **Delimitation of Constituencies:** The EC is responsible for delimiting the boundaries of the constituencies for the purpose of elections to Parliament. This is a crucial task to ensure equitable representation.
4.  **Holding Elections to Local Government Bodies:** In addition to national elections, the Constitution entrusts the EC with the responsibility of conducting elections for all local government bodies, such as City Corporations, Paurashavas, and Upazila and Union Parishads.
5.  **Performance of Other Functions:** The Commission is also required to perform any other functions as may be prescribed by the Constitution or any other law. This includes tasks like registering political parties, allocating electoral symbols, and enforcing the electoral code of conduct.

**Independence of the Commission:**
To ensure it can carry out these responsibilities impartially, **Article 118(4)** guarantees the independence of the Election Commission. It states that the "Election Commission shall be independent in the exercise of its functions and subject only to this Constitution and any other law." This constitutional backing is meant to shield the EC from executive or political pressure, enabling it to act as a neutral arbiter of the democratic process.

### **Question 09**

#### ~~**Describe the various movements, struggles, and events from the Language Movement to the Liberation War.** (Marks: 20)~~

~~**Answer:**~~

~~The period from the Language Movement in 1952 to the Liberation War in 1971 was a continuous and escalating struggle by the Bengali people for self-determination, cultural identity, and economic justice against the dominance of West Pakistan. This journey can be traced through a series of key movements and events.~~

1.  ~~**The Language Movement (1948-1952):** This was the genesis of Bengali nationalism. The Pakistani government's declaration of Urdu as the sole state language sparked widespread protests. The movement reached its peak on **February 21, 1952**, when police opened fire on protesting students in Dhaka, killing several, including Salam, Barkat, Rafiq, and Jabbar. This bloodshed cemented the demand for Bengali as a state language (which was granted in 1956) and sowed the first seeds of secession.~~

2.  ~~**The Formation of the United Front and the 1954 Election:** The Awami Muslim League, along with other parties, formed the **Jukto Front (United Front)**. Running on a platform of provincial autonomy outlined in their **21-Point Programme**, the United Front achieved a landslide victory in the 1954 East Bengal Legislative Assembly election, routing the Muslim League. However, the central government unjustly dismissed the United Front ministry after only 56 days, further alienating the Bengali populace.~~

3.  ~~**The 1958 Martial Law and Ayub Khan's Regime:** General Ayub Khan imposed martial law in 1958, banning political activities and introducing a system of "Basic Democracy" that denied direct suffrage. This decade of military rule intensified the feeling of political and economic deprivation in East Pakistan.~~

4.  ~~**The 1962 Education Movement:** A major student-led movement erupted against the recommendations of the Sharif Commission on Education, which was seen as discriminatory and aimed at curtailing access to education for Bengalis.~~

5.  ~~**The Six-Point Movement (1966):** This was the pivotal moment in the journey towards autonomy.  It called for a federal system, provincial autonomy, separate currencies, and the right for the province to maintain its own paramilitary force. It essentially laid out a blueprint for a nearly independent East Pakistan.~~

6.  ~~**The Agartala Conspiracy Case (1968):** To suppress the growing nationalist movement, the Ayub regime filed the Agartala Conspiracy Case, falsely implicating Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 34 others in a plot to secede East Pakistan with Indian help. This backfired spectacularly, turning Bangabandhu into an undisputed national hero.~~

7.  ~~**The Mass Uprising of 1969:** A massive popular uprising, spearheaded by students and their **11-Point Programme**, swept across East Pakistan. The movement demanded the withdrawal of the Agartala case and the resignation of Ayub Khan. The pressure was immense, leading to the release of Bangabandhu and the fall of the Ayub regime.~~

8.  ~~**The 1970 General Election:** The new military ruler, General Yahya Khan, held the first-ever general election based on universal adult franchise. The Awami League, under Bangabandhu's leadership, won an absolute majority, securing **167 out of 169** seats in East Pakistan and a majority in the National Assembly of Pakistan.~~

9.  ~~**The Non-Cooperation Movement (March 1971):** Despite the clear electoral verdict, the Pakistani military junta and West Pakistani politicians refused to transfer power. In response, Bangabandhu launched a nationwide non-cooperation movement. His historic **7th March Speech** served as the de facto declaration of independence.~~

~~This two-decade-long struggle, marked by continuous political, cultural, and economic resistance, culminated in the genocidal crackdown by the Pakistani army on **March 25, 1971**, which finally triggered the nine-month-long Liberation War and the birth of an independent Bangladesh.~~
