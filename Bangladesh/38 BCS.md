### **Question 01**

#### **(a) Who are the Rohingya?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
The **Rohingya** are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority group who have resided for centuries in the Rakhine State (formerly Arakan) of Myanmar. They speak a distinct dialect, which is related to the Chittagonian dialect of Bangladesh, and have their own unique culture and traditions.

Despite their long history in the region, they have been systematically denied citizenship and basic rights by the Myanmar state. The **1982 Burmese Citizenship Law** officially rendered them stateless, failing to include them among the country's 135 recognized ethnic groups.

This state-sponsored persecution has made them one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. They have faced decades of severe discrimination, restrictions on movement, limited access to education and healthcare, and waves of violent military crackdowns. The most brutal of these crackdowns occurred in **August 2017**, which the UN described as a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing" and has led to charges of genocide against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. This violence forced over 750,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, creating the world's largest refugee camp.

#### **(b) Discuss the crisis created for Bangladesh by the recent massive influx of Rohingya.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
The massive influx of over 750,000 Rohingya refugees in 2017, joining the hundreds of thousands already present, has created a severe and multifaceted crisis for Bangladesh, impacting its economy, environment, society, and security.

1.  **Economic Burden:** Hosting over 1.1 million refugees has placed an immense strain on the national budget. The annual cost of providing basic humanitarian assistance is estimated to be over **$1.2 billion**. This diverts critical resources that could otherwise be used for the development of Bangladesh's own citizens.
2.  **Environmental Degradation:** The establishment of the massive refugee camps in Cox's Bazar has led to catastrophic environmental damage. Over **6,800 acres of hills and forest land** were cleared to make space for shelters, leading to massive deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and increased risk of landslides. The immense pressure on local water sources has also led to a severe depletion of the groundwater table.
3.  **Social Tension and Labor Market Disruption:** The presence of a vast refugee population has created significant social tension with the local host community. There is increased competition for scarce resources like water and firewood. The availability of cheap Rohingya labor has also depressed local wage rates, negatively impacting the livelihoods of the host community.
4.  **Security Threats:** The densely populated and often desperate conditions in the camps have become a breeding ground for criminal activities. There has been a significant rise in **drug trafficking (especially yaba), human trafficking, arms smuggling, and violent conflicts** between armed Rohingya factions within the camps. These security challenges pose a direct threat not only to the local area but to the entire region.
5.  **Pressure on Infrastructure and Services:** The local infrastructure, including roads, healthcare facilities, and sanitation systems in the Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas, was not designed to support such a large population and has been completely overwhelmed.

---
#### **(c) Is there any way to be relieved from this problem?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
Yes, there is a way to be relieved from this problem, but it is complex and requires sustained and coordinated efforts at multiple levels. The only just and sustainable solution is the **safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable repatriation** of the Rohingya to their homeland in Rakhine State, Myanmar.

Key pathways to achieve this are:
1.  **Intensified Diplomatic Pressure:** Bangladesh must continue its diplomatic efforts to keep the Rohingya issue on the international agenda. This includes bilateral engagement with Myanmar, mobilizing regional bodies like **ASEAN**, and pressuring the **UN Security Council** to take decisive action.
2.  **Creation of a Conducive Environment in Myanmar:** The international community, particularly major powers like China, India, and ASEAN nations, must exert effective pressure on the Myanmar authorities to create a safe environment in Rakhine. This includes guaranteeing their security, restoring their citizenship rights (by repealing the 1982 Citizenship Law), and ensuring their access to land and livelihoods.
3.  **Accountability and Justice:** Pursuing justice through international mechanisms like the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** and the **International Criminal Court (ICC)** is crucial. Holding the perpetrators of the genocide accountable can act as a deterrent and is a key component of a durable solution.
4.  **Controlled Third-Country Resettlement:** While not a solution for the majority, a limited and controlled resettlement of the most vulnerable refugees to third countries can help alleviate some of the immediate pressure on Bangladesh.

Ultimately, relief from this crisis depends on the international community moving beyond providing humanitarian aid and committing to resolving the political and human rights crisis at its source: inside Myanmar.

### **Question 02**

#### **(a) Who is meant by a small ethnic group?** (Marks: 5)
*(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)*

**Answer:**
A **small ethnic group** (in Bengali: *Kshudra Nrigoshthi*) refers to a community of people who are numerically smaller than the dominant population of a country and who share a common ancestry, culture, language, and social customs that are distinct from the majority group. The Constitution of Bangladesh, in **Article 23A**, recognizes these communities.

Key characteristics include:
*   **Distinct Cultural Identity:** They possess their own unique languages, religious beliefs, festivals, and social structures.
*   **Self-Identification:** Members identify themselves, and are identified by others, as a distinct community.
*   **Historical Continuity:** They often have a deep-rooted connection to a specific territory.
*   **Non-Dominant Position:** They are in a non-dominant position within the society and may face challenges of marginalization.

---
### **Question 04**

#### **(a) Define the constitution. How many articles are there in the constitution of Bangladesh?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
A **constitution** is the supreme and fundamental law of a sovereign state. It is a comprehensive legal document that establishes the framework and principal functions of the organs of the government (the executive, legislature, and judiciary), defines their powers, and sets the limits of those powers. It also guarantees the fundamental rights of the citizens and outlines their relationship with the state.

The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh consists of a Preamble, **153 articles** organized into 11 parts, and **7 schedules**. It is the ultimate source of all legal authority in the country, and any law inconsistent with it is void.

#### **(c) Describe the composition, powers, and functions of the Jatiya Sangsad of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
The Jatiya Sangsad (House of the Nation) is the unicameral supreme legislative body of Bangladesh.

**Composition (as per Articles 65 & 66):**
*   The Jatiya Sangsad consists of **350 members**.
*   **300 members** are directly elected from single-member territorial constituencies based on universal adult franchise for a term of five years.
*   **50 seats** are reserved exclusively for women. These women members are elected by the 300 directly elected members, based on the proportional representation of the political parties in the parliament.

**Powers and Functions:**
The Jatiya Sangsad holds significant powers as the center of the country's democratic process.
1.  **Legislative Power:** Its primary function is to make laws. It can enact new laws, amend existing laws, and repeal old ones. A bill passed by the Sangsad becomes law upon receiving the President's assent.
2.  **Financial Power:** The Parliament has complete control over the country's finances.
    *   No tax can be levied or collected without the authority of an Act of Parliament.
    *   It passes the **annual budget** and supplementary budgets, thereby authorizing all government expenditure.
    *   It scrutinizes public spending through its various committees, such as the Public Accounts Committee.
3.  **Control over the Executive:** The Cabinet, including the Prime Minister, is collectively responsible to the Parliament (**Article 55(3)**). The Parliament can hold the government accountable through various mechanisms like question-answer sessions, adjournment motions, and no-confidence motions.
4.  **Constituent Power:** The Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, requiring a vote of not less than **two-thirds** of the total number of members (**Article 142**).
5.  **Judicial Power:** It has the power to impeach the President for grave misconduct or violation of the Constitution.

### **Question 05**

#### **(a) What is the difference between the freedom struggle and the liberation war?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
While often used interchangeably, "freedom struggle" (স্বাধীনতা সংগ্রাম) and "liberation war" (মুক্তিযুদ্ধ) have distinct meanings in the context of Bangladesh's history.

| Basis of Difference | **Freedom Struggle (স্বাধীনতা সংগ্রাম)** | **Liberation War (মুক্তিযুদ্ধ)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | A long, continuous **political, cultural, and social movement** aimed at achieving rights, autonomy, and freedom from oppression. | A formal, declared **armed conflict** or war fought to achieve complete sovereign independence. |
| **Time Period** | A prolonged period. In Bangladesh's case, it spans the **24 years from 1947 to 1971**, encompassing all movements from the Language Movement to the 1970 election. | A specific, defined period of armed combat. For Bangladesh, this is the **nine-month period from March 26, 1971, to December 16, 1971**. |
| **Methods** | The methods were primarily non-violent and political, including protests, strikes, civil disobedience, negotiations, and elections. | The method was primarily military, involving organized armed resistance, guerrilla warfare, and conventional battles fought by the Mukti Bahini. |
| **Scope** | It was a broader struggle for self-determination and the establishment of rights. | It was the final, decisive, and armed phase of the broader freedom struggle, with the singular goal of achieving territorial independence. |

In essence, the Liberation War was the violent and climactic culmination of the long and arduous Freedom Struggle. The struggle created the political and ideological foundation upon which the war was fought and won.

### **Question 07**

#### **(b) What are the problems and prospects in the extraction and industrial use of our mineral resources?** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
Bangladesh is endowed with several valuable mineral resources, but their extraction and industrial use are fraught with both significant challenges and immense prospects.

**Main Mineral Resources:** Natural Gas, Coal, Limestone, Hard Rock, and a recent discovery of a potential gold mine.

**Problems and Challenges:**
1.  **Technological and Financial Constraints:** The extraction of deep-lying mineral resources, such as the coal deposits in Phulbari and Dighipara, requires massive capital investment and advanced technology, which Bangladesh often lacks. This leads to dependence on foreign companies and loans.
2.  **Environmental and Social Concerns:**
    *   **Coal Mining:** Open-pit coal mining, while economically cheaper, poses severe environmental risks, including the destruction of vast tracts of fertile agricultural land, depletion and contamination of groundwater, and the displacement of local communities. This has led to strong public resistance, as seen in the Phulbari movement.
    *   **Gas Extraction:** The extraction process carries risks of environmental pollution and gas field blowouts if not managed with the highest safety standards.
3.  **Lack of Comprehensive Policy and Governance:** There is often a lack of a clear, long-term national policy on mineral extraction that balances economic needs with environmental protection and social equity. Issues of transparency and governance in awarding contracts to international companies are also a concern.
4.  **Inadequate Infrastructure:** A lack of supporting infrastructure, such as dedicated transport corridors (railways, waterways) for moving bulky minerals like coal and hard rock from the mine to industrial centers, increases costs and logistical challenges.

**Prospects and Potential:**
1.  **Energy Security:** The successful and sustainable extraction of domestic coal and natural gas can significantly reduce Bangladesh's dependence on expensive imported energy (like LNG and oil), ensuring long-term energy security for its growing industries.
2.  **Industrial Raw Materials:** Locally extracted limestone and hard rock are vital raw materials for the booming cement and construction industries, reducing import dependency and saving foreign currency.
3.  **Economic Growth and Employment:** A well-managed mining sector can contribute significantly to the national GDP, create specialized jobs, and spur the development of backward regions where the resources are located.
4.  **Attracting FDI:** By creating a transparent and stable policy environment, Bangladesh can attract high-quality Foreign Direct Investment in the mining sector, bringing in much-needed capital and technology.

To realize these prospects, Bangladesh must formulate a comprehensive national mineral policy that prioritizes environmental sustainability, ensures the rights of local communities, and promotes transparent governance.

Of course. Here are the detailed, data-rich answers for the final questions from the "Bangladesh Affairs" paper (`./22.jpg`).

### **Question 01 (continued)**

#### **(c) Is there any way to be relieved from this problem?** (Marks: 5)
*(This question about the Rohingya crisis is a duplicate from the previous paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)*

**Answer:**
Yes, there is a way to be relieved from the Rohingya crisis, but it requires a sustained, multi-pronged strategy. The only just and durable solution is the **safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable repatriation** of the Rohingya to their homeland in Rakhine State, Myanmar.

Key pathways to achieve this are:
1.  **Intensified Diplomatic Pressure:** Bangladesh must continue its diplomatic efforts to keep the Rohingya issue on the international agenda. This includes bilateral engagement with Myanmar, mobilizing regional bodies like **ASEAN**, and pressuring the **UN Security Council** to take decisive action.
2.  **Creation of a Conducive Environment in Myanmar:** The international community, particularly major powers with influence over Myanmar (like China, India, and ASEAN nations), must compel the Myanmar authorities to create a safe environment. This includes guaranteeing their security, restoring their citizenship rights (by repealing the 1982 Citizenship Law), and ensuring their access to land and livelihoods.
3.  **Accountability and Justice:** Pursuing justice through international mechanisms like the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** and the **International Criminal Court (ICC)** is crucial. Holding the perpetrators of the genocide accountable is a key component of a durable solution.
4.  **Controlled Third-Country Resettlement:** While not a solution for the majority, a limited and controlled resettlement of the most vulnerable refugees to third countries can help alleviate some of the immediate pressure on Bangladesh.

### **Question 03**

#### **(a) Where and why did the Mujibnagar Government take its oath?** (Marks: 5)
*(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)*

**Answer:**
The Mujibnagar Government, the provisional government of Bangladesh, took its oath of office on **April 17, 1971**.

*   **Where:** The ceremony was held at **Baidyanathtala**, a mango grove in the Meherpur subdivision of the then Kushtia district. This location was strategically chosen as it was close to the Indian border, providing a degree of security from the Pakistani army. After the ceremony, Baidyanathtala was officially renamed **Mujibnagar**.

*   **Why:** The oath-taking ceremony was a crucial political and symbolic act for several reasons:
    1.  **To Formalize the Government:** It formally established a legitimate government to lead the Liberation War, transforming the struggle from a spontaneous resistance into an organized, state-led war for independence.
    2.  **To Gain International Recognition:** By forming a constitutional government and holding a public oath-taking ceremony in the presence of domestic and international journalists, the aim was to demonstrate to the world that Bangladesh's struggle was not a secessionist movement but a legitimate fight for self-determination led by the elected representatives of the people.
    3.  **To Establish a Chain of Command:** The ceremony established a clear political leadership and a formal chain of command for the Mukti Bahini (Liberation Army), which was essential for coordinating the war effort.

### **Question 06**

#### **(a) What is meant by human resources?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
**Human resources** refer to the collective stock of knowledge, skills, creativity, talent, and abilities of the people who make up the workforce of an organization, business sector, industry, or economy. It represents the human factor in production, the individuals who are capable of performing labor to produce goods and services.

More broadly, human resources are considered a nation's most valuable asset. The concept moves beyond simply counting the number of people in a population (human capital) and focuses on their **quality**. A country's human resources are developed through investments in:
*   **Education:** From primary literacy to higher and specialized education.
*   **Health and Nutrition:** Ensuring a physically and mentally healthy populace.
*   **Skills Development:** Providing technical and vocational training to make the workforce productive and adaptable.

When a country successfully develops its human resources, its large population can be transformed from a potential liability into a **"demographic dividend,"** becoming the primary engine for innovation, productivity, and economic growth.

### **Question 09**

#### **(b) 'Despite being a developing country, Bangladesh is quite capable in disaster management' - Discuss.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
The statement that Bangladesh is quite capable in disaster management despite its developing country status is accurate. Over the past few decades, Bangladesh has transformed itself from a country synonymous with disaster-related tragedy to a globally recognized **role model for disaster management and climate adaptation**.

This capability is built on a comprehensive and proactive approach:

1.  **Robust Institutional and Legal Framework:**
    *   Bangladesh has a strong legal framework, including the **Disaster Management Act, 2012**, and a **National Plan for Disaster Management**.
    *   It has a multi-tiered institutional structure, from the **National Disaster Management Council (NDMC)** at the highest level down to Union Disaster Management Committees at the grassroots, ensuring a coordinated response.

2.  **World-Class Early Warning System:**
    *   The country has developed a sophisticated and effective early warning system for cyclones and floods. The **Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP)**, with its network of over **76,000 trained volunteers**, is a world-renowned model for community-based warning dissemination. This system successfully evacuated millions of people to safety during recent powerful cyclones like Amphan and Mocha.

3.  **Extensive Network of Shelters:**
    *   The government, with the help of development partners, has built a vast network of multi-purpose cyclone and flood shelters across its coastal and flood-prone areas. There are over **14,000 shelters** nationwide, capable of accommodating millions of people and their livestock.

4.  **Investment in Protective Infrastructure:**
    *   Bangladesh has invested heavily in structural mitigation measures, including the construction of thousands of kilometers of coastal embankments, river dykes, and polders to protect communities from storm surges and flooding.

5.  **Community-Based Adaptation:**
    *   A key to Bangladesh's success is its focus on community-based adaptation. This includes promoting climate-resilient agriculture (e.g., saline-tolerant rice varieties), rainwater harvesting, and creating alternative livelihoods for vulnerable communities.

**Evidence of Success:**
The success of this system is evident in the dramatic reduction in casualties from major disasters. In the 1970 Bhola cyclone, an estimated 500,000 people died. In contrast, during the equally powerful Cyclone Sidr in 2007, the death toll was around 3,500, and in recent cyclones, it has been reduced to double or single digits—a testament to the effectiveness of Bangladesh's disaster management system.

### **Question 10: Write short notes (any four): (5x4 = 20)**

#### **(a) Administrative Tribunal**

**Answer:**
An **Administrative Tribunal** is a specialized, quasi-judicial body established in Bangladesh to adjudicate disputes related to the public service. Its creation is mandated by **Article 117** of the Constitution of Bangladesh.

*   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of the Administrative Tribunal is to provide a separate and expert forum for resolving matters concerning the terms and conditions of service of persons in the service of the Republic. This includes disputes related to recruitment, promotion, seniority, disciplinary actions (e.g., dismissal, removal), and pensions.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction over these matters. This means that a public servant cannot directly file a writ petition in the High Court Division regarding a service dispute; they must first seek remedy from the Administrative Tribunal.
*   **Structure:** The system consists of Administrative Tribunals at the lower level and an **Administrative Appellate Tribunal** at the higher level, to which appeals from the lower tribunals can be made.
*   **Significance:** By creating a specialized forum, the Administrative Tribunal is intended to reduce the burden on the regular courts and to ensure that service-related disputes are resolved quickly and efficiently by judges who have expertise in administrative and service law.

#### **(c) Martyred Intellectuals' Day**

**Answer:**
**Martyred Intellectuals' Day (Shaheed Buddhijibi Dibosh)** is observed in Bangladesh on **December 14** each year to commemorate the intellectuals who were systematically killed by the Pakistani army and their local collaborators (Al-Badr, Al-Shams) just before the end of the Liberation War in 1971.

*   **The Killings:** In a final, horrific act of brutality, as Pakistan's defeat became imminent, its forces and their collaborators abducted and murdered hundreds of Bangladesh's most prominent intellectuals—including professors, doctors, journalists, artists, engineers, and writers. The aim of this targeted massacre was to cripple the new nation intellectually and culturally at its very inception.
*   **Discovery:** The horrifying scale of the killings became apparent after the victory on December 16, when the mutilated bodies of these intellectuals were discovered in mass graves, most notably at **Rayerbazar** and **Mirpur** in Dhaka.
*   **Commemoration:** The day is observed with deep solemnity. The national flag is flown at half-mast. People pay homage to the martyrs by placing wreaths at the Martyred Intellectuals' Memorial at Mirpur and the memorial at Rayerbazar. Discussions and cultural programs are held to remember their sacrifice and reflect on their contribution to the nation.

Martyred Intellectuals' Day is a somber reminder of the immense price paid for Bangladesh's independence and the barbaric attempt to destroy its intellectual foundation.
