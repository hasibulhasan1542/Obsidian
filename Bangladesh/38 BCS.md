### **Question 01**

**(a) Who are the Rohingyas? (5)**

**Answer:**
The Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority group who have resided for centuries in the Rakhine State (formerly Arakan) of Myanmar. They represent the largest percentage of Muslims in Myanmar, with a distinct language and culture that differs from the majority Bamar population.

Key aspects of their identity are:
*   **Origin and History:** Rohingya historians claim their presence in the Arakan region dates back to the 8th century, with ancestors including Arabs, Moors, and Persians who came as traders and settlers. Their identity solidified under the independent Kingdom of Mrauk-U.
*   **Language:** They speak the Rohingya language, which is an Indo-European language belonging to the Bengali-Assamese branch, distinct from the Sino-Tibetan Burmese language.
*   **Statelessness:** Despite their long history in the region, the 1982 Myanmar Citizenship Law effectively rendered them stateless. The government of Myanmar refuses to recognize them as one of the country's 135 official ethnic groups, instead labeling them as illegal "Bengali" immigrants from Bangladesh.
*   **Persecution:** As a result of their statelessness and ethno-religious identity, the Rohingya have faced decades of severe persecution, discrimination, and state-sponsored violence, including restrictions on movement, marriage, education, and access to basic services. This has culminated in several waves of violent crackdowns, forcing them to flee to neighboring countries, particularly Bangladesh.

**(b) Discuss the crisis that Bangladesh has faced due to the massive Rohingya influx in recent times. (10)**

**Answer:**
The massive influx of Rohingya refugees, particularly the exodus of over 750,000 following the military crackdown in August 2017, has created a multi-dimensional and severe crisis for Bangladesh. Bangladesh now hosts over 1.2 million Rohingya refugees, concentrated in the Cox's Bazar district.

The key aspects of the crisis are:

1.  **Humanitarian and Economic Burden:** Providing food, shelter, healthcare, and sanitation for such a large population has placed an enormous strain on Bangladesh's national resources. While international aid covers a portion of the costs, the government bears a significant economic burden in terms of infrastructure development, administration, and resource allocation.
2.  **Environmental Degradation:** The refugee camps have been established by clearing vast areas of protected forest land and hills in the Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas. This has led to massive deforestation, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of local water sources, creating a severe environmental crisis.
3.  **Socio-Economic Tensions:** The presence of a large refugee population has created tensions with the host community. Local wages have been depressed due to the availability of cheap refugee labor. Prices of essential commodities and land have skyrocketed, and local infrastructure and services are overwhelmed, leading to resentment among the local Bangladeshi population.
4.  **Security and Law and Order Challenges:** The densely populated and impoverished camps have become breeding grounds for various criminal activities. This includes drug trafficking (especially Yaba), human trafficking, internal conflicts between Rohingya factions, and the emergence of armed groups. This poses a significant internal security threat to Bangladesh.
5.  **Stalled Repatriation and Diplomatic Pressure:** The primary solution—the safe, dignified, and voluntary repatriation of the Rohingya to Myanmar—has completely stalled. Despite bilateral agreements, Myanmar has failed to create the necessary conditions for their return. This has left Bangladesh in a prolonged diplomatic and political impasse, bearing the burden of a crisis it did not create.

**(c) What are the ways to get relief from this problem? (5)**

**Answer:**
Resolving the Rohingya crisis requires a multi-pronged, sustained, and internationally coordinated effort, as Bangladesh cannot solve this problem alone. The key ways forward are:

1.  **Intensified International Diplomatic Pressure on Myanmar:** The international community, particularly major powers like China, Russia, the USA, and regional bodies like ASEAN, must exert unified and sustained pressure on the Myanmar authorities to create a conducive environment for repatriation. This includes granting citizenship rights, ensuring security, and rebuilding communities.
2.  **Accountability and Justice:** Pursuing justice for the atrocities committed against the Rohingya through international legal mechanisms like the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) is crucial. Holding the perpetrators accountable can act as a deterrent and is a key demand of the Rohingya for their safe return.
3.  **Active Engagement of the UN:** The United Nations, particularly the UNHCR and the UN Security Council, must play a more proactive and assertive role. This includes negotiating the terms of repatriation, monitoring the situation on the ground in Rakhine, and ensuring that any return is truly voluntary, safe, and dignified.
4.  **Third-Country Resettlement:** While repatriation is the primary goal, exploring options for resettling a portion of the refugees in third countries that are willing to accept them can help alleviate the immense burden on Bangladesh.
5.  **Managing the Camps Effectively:** In the interim, Bangladesh, with continued and enhanced international support, must focus on managing the camps effectively to mitigate security and environmental risks. This includes providing education and skill development for the refugees (especially the youth) to prevent radicalization and better prepare them for their eventual return.

### **Question 02**

**(a) Who are meant by the term "small ethnic groups"? (5)**

**Answer:**
The term "small ethnic groups" (*khudro nrigoshthi*), as used in the context of Bangladesh, refers to the indigenous communities who have distinct social, cultural, and linguistic identities that differ from the majority Bengali population. The Constitution of Bangladesh recognizes them under the term "tribes, minor races, ethnic sects and communities" (Article 23A).

Key characteristics that define them are:
*   **Distinct Culture and Traditions:** They have their own unique customs, religious beliefs (which are often a blend of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, or animism), festivals, and social structures.
*   **Distinct Language:** Most groups have their own languages, which typically belong to linguistic families other than the Indo-Aryan family of the Bengali language (e.g., Tibeto-Burman, Austroasiatic).
*   **Historical Connection to Land:** They often have a deep spiritual and historical connection to their ancestral lands and territories, with traditional livelihoods based on a close relationship with nature (e.g., *jum* cultivation).
*   **Self-Identification:** A crucial element is their self-identification as a distinct indigenous or tribal people.
*   **Numerical Minority:** They constitute a small fraction (around 1.5-2%) of the total population of Bangladesh and are often politically and economically marginalized. Prominent groups include the Chakma, Marma, Santal, Garo, and Tripura.

**(b) Evaluate the contribution of small ethnic groups to the economic and social fields of Bangladesh. (10)**

**Answer:**
The small ethnic groups of Bangladesh, despite being a minority, make unique and valuable contributions to the nation's economic and social fabric, enriching its diversity and heritage.

**Economic Contributions:**
1.  **Agriculture and Horticulture:** Indigenous communities are pioneers in horticulture in the hilly regions. They cultivate fruits like mangoes, bananas, pineapples, and jackfruits, and other cash crops like ginger, turmeric, and bamboo, which contribute significantly to the national and local economy.
2.  **Forestry and Resource Management:** Their traditional knowledge of forest ecosystems and sustainable resource management is an invaluable asset. They contribute to the economy through the collection and trade of non-timber forest products like bamboo, cane, and medicinal plants.
3.  **Handicrafts and Textiles:** Indigenous women are renowned for their exquisite hand-woven textiles and handicrafts. The unique designs and patterns of their fabrics (*pinon*, *hadi*) have a niche market and contribute to the cottage industry, holding significant potential for export.
4.  **Tourism:** The unique culture, traditions, and scenic beauty of the areas inhabited by ethnic groups, particularly the Chittagong Hill Tracts, are a major draw for domestic and international tourism, creating economic opportunities.

**Social Contributions:**
1.  **Cultural Diversity:** They are the primary source of Bangladesh's cultural diversity. Their distinct languages, music, dance, festivals (like Bizu, Wangala), and culinary traditions enrich the national cultural tapestry, making it more vibrant and pluralistic.
2.  **Environmental Stewardship:** Their traditional values often promote a harmonious relationship with nature. Their knowledge systems represent an alternative and often more sustainable approach to living, which is increasingly relevant in an era of environmental crisis.
3.  **National History:** Indigenous communities have actively participated in the nation's history, including significant contributions during the British colonial period and the 1971 Liberation War, which are an integral part of the national narrative.

**(c) Is there any role played by the government in the development of the lifestyle of the small ethnic groups? (5)**

**Answer:**
Yes, the Government of Bangladesh has played a role and undertaken several initiatives aimed at the development of the lifestyle of small ethnic groups, although the effectiveness and implementation of these roles are often debated.

Key government roles and initiatives include:
1.  **Constitutional Recognition and Protection:** The 15th Amendment to the Constitution added Article 23A, which mandates the state to "protect and develop the unique local culture and tradition of the tribes, minor races, ethnic sects and communities." This provides a constitutional basis for government action.
2.  **Specialized Institutions:** The government has established dedicated institutions to oversee their welfare. The most important is the **Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs**, which deals specifically with the CHT region. For plain-land indigenous groups, there is a special assistance program under the Prime Minister's Office.
3.  **CHT Peace Accord (1997):** The signing of this accord was a landmark government initiative to end the decades-long conflict in the CHT and establish a system of regional self-governance through the Regional Council and Hill District Councils, giving them authority over land, resources, and local administration.
4.  **Educational and Economic Support:** The government provides special quotas for indigenous students in public universities and higher education institutions. It also provides stipends and scholarships. Special economic projects are often undertaken in their areas to improve livelihoods.
5.  **Cultural Preservation:** The government has established cultural institutes in areas with large indigenous populations (e.g., the Tribal Cultural Institute in Rangamati) to preserve and promote their unique languages and cultures.

Despite these initiatives, challenges in full implementation, land rights disputes, and bureaucratic hurdles remain significant obstacles to their holistic development.

### **Question 03**

**(a) Where and why did the Mujibnagar Government take oath? (5)**

**Answer:**
*   **Where:** The Mujibnagar Government, the first provisional government of Bangladesh, took its oath of office on **April 17, 1971**, at a mango grove in the village of **Baidyanathtala**, which was located in the Meherpur subdivision of the then Kushtia district. After the ceremony, Baidyanathtala was renamed **Mujibnagar** ("the city of Mujib") in honor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The location was strategically chosen as it was close to the Indian border, providing a degree of security from the Pakistani army.

*   **Why:** The formation and public inauguration of the Mujibnagar Government were a masterstroke of political and diplomatic strategy for several crucial reasons:
    1.  **To Provide Legitimate Political Leadership:** It was formed to give the spontaneous resistance movement a formal, centralized, and legitimate political leadership. This transformed the war from a scattered revolt into an organized war of national liberation led by a constitutional government.
    2.  **To Gain International Recognition:** A formal government was essential to seek international recognition and support. It allowed them to conduct diplomacy, appeal for aid, and represent the cause of Bangladesh on the world stage as a legal entity, not just a secessionist movement.
    3.  **To Legalize the Liberation War:** The government was formed by the elected representatives of the 1970 general election. This constitutional legitimacy allowed it to formally declare independence and frame the war as a just struggle of a democratically elected majority against a genocidal military occupation.

**(b) What were the roles of the United States, the then Soviet Union, China, and India in the Liberation War of Bangladesh? (10)**

**Answer:**
The roles of these four major powers during the 1971 Liberation War were vastly different and critically impacted the outcome of the conflict.

*   **India:** India played the most direct and supportive role, which was indispensable for Bangladesh's victory.
    *   **Humanitarian Support:** It provided shelter to an estimated 10 million Bengali refugees who fled the Pakistani crackdown.
    *   **Military Support:** It provided training, arms, and logistical support to the Mukti Bahini.
    *   **Direct Military Intervention:** In December 1971, India intervened directly, forming a "Joint Command" with the Mukti Bahini. The Indian military's swift and decisive campaign led to the surrender of the Pakistani forces in just 13 days.
    *   **Diplomatic Support:** India launched a global diplomatic offensive to build support for Bangladesh's cause.

*   **The Soviet Union:** The USSR was Bangladesh's most powerful diplomatic ally.
    *   **Indo-Soviet Treaty:** In August 1971, India and the Soviet Union signed a "Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation," which acted as a major deterrent against potential Chinese or US intervention on Pakistan's behalf.
    *   **UN Veto Power:** During the war, the Soviet Union used its veto power in the UN Security Council three times to block resolutions backed by the US and China that called for a ceasefire without addressing the political solution and the withdrawal of Pakistani troops. This gave the Indian and Bangladeshi forces the crucial time needed to win the war.

*   **The United States:** The US administration under President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger infamously "tilted" towards Pakistan.
    *   **Support for Pakistan:** The US viewed Pakistan as a key ally in its Cold War strategy, particularly as a conduit to open relations with China. It provided diplomatic, economic, and clandestine military support to the Pakistani regime, despite being aware of the genocide.
    *   **Naval Threat:** In a show of force, the US dispatched its Seventh Fleet, led by the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, to the Bay of Bengal, posing a threat to the Indian forces.
    *   **Exception:** It is important to note that many US politicians, the media, and the general public were highly critical of their government's policy and sympathetic to the Bengali cause.

*   **China:** China was a staunch ally of Pakistan and vehemently opposed the creation of Bangladesh.
    *   **Diplomatic and Military Support for Pakistan:** China provided significant military aid and strong diplomatic support to Pakistan, denouncing the liberation struggle as a plot by Indian "expansionists."
    *   **Threat of Intervention:** It made threatening military movements along its border with India, though it stopped short of direct intervention, partly due to the Indo-Soviet treaty and the difficult Himalayan terrain in winter.
    *   **Blocked UN Membership:** After the war, China used its veto power to block Bangladesh's entry into the United Nations until 1974.

**(c) What is the significance of the Instrument of Surrender? (5)**

**Answer:**
The Instrument of Surrender, signed on December 16, 1971, is a document of profound historical significance for Bangladesh and the world.

1.  **Formal End of War and Birth of a Nation:** It formally marked the end of the nine-month-long bloody Liberation War and the definitive military victory of the Bangladesh-India Joint Command. Most importantly, it signified the birth of Bangladesh as a sovereign and independent nation, free from Pakistani rule.
2.  **Legitimization of Victory:** The unconditional surrender of the Pakistan Eastern Command under Lieutenant-General A. A. K. Niazi was a public and legal admission of defeat. It legitimized the outcome of the war and the establishment of the new state in the eyes of the world.
3.  **A Historic Military Event:** The surrender of approximately 93,000 Pakistani military and paramilitary personnel was the largest military surrender in the world since the end of World War II. This highlighted the scale and decisiveness of the victory.
4.  **Symbol of National Triumph:** The signing ceremony at the Ramna Race Course (now Suhrawardy Udyan), the very place where Bangabandhu delivered his historic March 7th speech calling for the struggle for freedom, was deeply symbolic. It represented the triumphant culmination of the Bengali people's long struggle for self-determination and justice.

### **Question 04**

**(a) Define constitution. How many articles are there in the Constitution of Bangladesh? (5)**

**Answer:**
*   **Definition of Constitution:** A constitution is the supreme law of a country. It is a set of fundamental principles, rules, and established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed. It outlines the structure of the government, defines the powers and functions of its principal organs (the legislature, executive, and judiciary), and sets out the fundamental rights and duties of its citizens. A constitution can be written (like in Bangladesh, the USA, and India) or unwritten (like in the United Kingdom). It provides the legal foundation for the state and ensures that the government acts within its legal limits.

*   **Number of Articles:** The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh currently has **153 articles**. It is divided into a Preamble, 11 Parts, and 7 Schedules.

**(b) Describe the composition, powers, and functions of the Jatiya Sangsad of Bangladesh. (10)**

**Answer:**
The Jatiya Sangsad (House of the Nation) is the unicameral national legislature of Bangladesh, established under Part V of the Constitution.

**Composition (Article 65):**
*   The Jatiya Sangsad consists of **350 members**.
*   **300 members** are directly elected from 300 single-territorial constituencies through a general election based on the first-past-the-post voting system.
*   **50 seats** are reserved exclusively for women. These women MPs are elected by the 300 directly elected members based on the proportional representation of the political parties in Parliament.

**Powers and Functions:**
The powers and functions of the Jatiya Sangsad are extensive and central to the country's governance:
1.  **Legislative Power:** Its primary function is to make, amend, and repeal laws for the country. No bill can become a law without being passed by the Jatiya Sangsad and receiving the President's assent.
2.  **Financial Powers:** The Parliament holds the "power of the purse," giving it ultimate control over the country's finances.
    *   No tax can be imposed without its approval.
    *   The annual budget, detailing government expenditure and revenue, must be presented to and passed by the Parliament.
3.  **Executive Accountability:** The Jatiya Sangsad ensures the accountability of the government (the Executive).
    *   The Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, is collectively responsible to the Parliament.
    *   It can remove the government by passing a vote of no-confidence.
    *   It uses tools like Question Hour, motions, and debates to scrutinize the government's actions.
4.  **Constitutional Power:** It has the power to amend the Constitution of the Republic with a two-thirds majority vote of its members.
5.  **Judicial Power:** It has the power of impeachment, meaning it can remove the President, Speaker, or, under certain (now voided) amendments, even Supreme Court judges for misconduct.
6.  **Electoral Functions:** The Jatiya Sangsad elects the President of the Republic and also elects the members for the 50 reserved women's seats.

**(c) How rational is it to keep seats reserved for women in the Parliament? (5)**

**Answer:**
Keeping seats reserved for women in the Parliament is a highly rational and necessary form of affirmative action, especially in the context of a patriarchal society like Bangladesh. The rationale is based on principles of equity, representation, and social justice.

**Arguments for its Rationality:**
1.  **Ensuring Political Representation:** In a society where structural barriers (social, economic, and political) make it extremely difficult for women to get nominated by major parties and win in direct elections, reserved seats guarantee a minimum level of female representation in the highest law-making body. Without it, women's voices would be severely underrepresented.
2.  **Addressing Historical Disadvantage:** It is a corrective measure to compensate for centuries of historical discrimination that has excluded women from public life and decision-making processes.
3.  **Promoting Women's Issues:** The presence of women MPs ensures that issues of particular concern to women—such as gender-based violence, maternal health, and women's economic empowerment—are more likely to be raised and addressed in Parliament.
4.  **Acting as a Catalyst:** The system acts as a stepping stone. It provides women with experience in politics and public life, creating a pool of experienced female leaders who can then go on to contest and win in direct elections, as many have done.
5.  **Fulfilling Constitutional Mandates:** The provision aligns with the constitutional principle (Article 28(4)) that allows the state to make special provisions in favor of women to ensure their advancement.

While the ultimate goal is for women to win a significant number of seats through direct competition, the reserved seat system remains a rational and essential transitional mechanism to ensure substantive gender equality in politics until the structural barriers are overcome.

### **Question 05**

~~**(a) What is the difference between the freedom struggle and the liberation war? (5)**~~

~~**Answer:**~~
~~While often used interchangeably, "freedom struggle" and "liberation war" have distinct connotations, especially in the context of Bangladesh.~~

*   ~~**Freedom Struggle (*Shadhinota Shongram*):** This is a broader and longer-term concept. It refers to the entire historical process and the series of political, cultural, and social movements aimed at achieving self-determination and freedom from oppression. In Bangladesh's context, the freedom struggle encompasses the entire period from the 1947 Partition, including the 1952 Language Movement, the 1962 Education Movement, the 1966 Six-Point Movement, and the 1969 Mass Uprising. It was a prolonged, largely political struggle to establish the rights and identity of the Bengali people.~~

*   ~~**Liberation War (*Muktijuddho*):** This is a more specific term. It refers to the final, armed phase of the freedom struggle. For Bangladesh, the Liberation War specifically denotes the nine-month-long conventional and guerrilla war fought from March 26 to December 16, 1971, against the occupying Pakistani army. It was the military conflict that culminated in the achievement of independence.~~

~~**In summary:** The Liberation War was the armed culmination of the decades-long Freedom Struggle. The struggle provided the political and ideological foundation, while the war provided the military victory.~~

**(b) Discuss the phases of Bangladesh's struggle for independence from 1947 to 1971. (10)**

**Answer:**
The struggle for Bangladesh's independence was not a sudden event but a gradual, phased evolution of Bengali national consciousness against West Pakistani domination. The key phases are:

1.  **Phase 1: The Struggle for Cultural and Linguistic Identity (1947-1952):** The first assault came against Bengali culture. The attempt by the Pakistani state to impose Urdu as the sole national language led to the **1952 Language Movement**. The martyrdom of students on February 21st established the primacy of Bengali cultural identity over a shared religious identity and sowed the first seeds of nationalism.

2.  **Phase 2: The Struggle for Political and Economic Rights (1954-1966):** After securing linguistic rights, the focus shifted to political and economic disparities. The victory of the **United Front** in the 1954 election was a clear rejection of the ruling elite. Throughout this period, East Pakistan faced severe economic exploitation. This phase culminated in **1966**, when Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman presented his **Six-Point Program**, a charter for radical regional autonomy that became the "charter of survival" for the Bengali people.

3.  **Phase 3: The Rise of Mass Nationalism and Confrontation (1966-1969):** The Pakistani regime responded to the Six-Point Program with repression, filing the **Agartala Conspiracy Case** against Sheikh Mujib. This led to the **1969 Mass Uprising (*Gono Obbhyutthan*)**, a spontaneous and powerful movement that forced the fall of the Ayub Khan dictatorship, secured the release of Sheikh Mujib, and cemented his status as the undisputed leader of the Bengalis.

4.  **Phase 4: The Democratic Mandate and Final Betrayal (1970-March 1971):** The **1970 General Election** was the final political phase. The Awami League's landslide victory gave it a clear democratic mandate to frame a constitution based on the Six-Points. The refusal of the Pakistani military-political establishment to transfer power led to Bangabandhu's historic **March 7th Speech**, which was a de facto declaration of independence, and the launch of the non-cooperation movement.

5.  **Phase 5: The Armed Liberation War (March 26 - December 16, 1971):** The final phase began with the Pakistani army's genocidal crackdown on the night of March 25th ("Operation Searchlight"). This transformed the political struggle into an all-out **Liberation War**, which lasted for nine months and ended with the surrender of the Pakistani forces and the birth of an independent Bangladesh.

**(c) Write down the names of the Birsreshthas. (5)**

**Answer:**
The "Birsreshtha" (The Most Valiant Hero) is the highest military gallantry award in Bangladesh. It was posthumously awarded to seven freedom fighters for their extraordinary courage and ultimate sacrifice during the 1971 Liberation War.

The seven Birsreshthas are:
1.  **Captain Mohiuddin Jahangir**
2.  **Sepoy Hamidur Rahman**
3.  **Sepoy Mostafa Kamal**
4.  **Engine Room Artificer Ruhul Amin**
5.  **Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman**
6.  **Lance Naik Munshi Abdur Rouf**
7.  **Lance Naik Nur Mohammad Sheikh**

### **Question 06**

**(a) What is meant by human resources? (5)**

**Answer:**
Human resources refer to the collective stock of knowledge, skills, talents, creativity, and abilities of the people within a population that can be utilized for economic and social development. It is not just about the number of people, but about their quality. Human resources encompass the physical labor, intellectual capacity, and technical expertise that individuals can contribute to the production of goods and services. A well-developed human resource base is considered the most valuable asset of a nation, as it is the people who drive innovation, manage other resources (like capital and land), and ultimately create wealth. Investing in human resources through education, healthcare, and training is therefore fundamental to a country's long-term progress.

**(b) 'The importance of education is paramount for the development of skilled human resources' - Discuss. (10)**

**Answer:**
The statement that the importance of education is paramount for developing skilled human resources is absolutely correct. Education is the foundational process through which a raw population is transformed into a skilled, productive, and innovative workforce, which is the engine of modern economic growth.

The discussion points are as follows:
1.  **Foundation of Basic Skills:** Basic education provides literacy and numeracy, which are the essential building blocks for all further learning and skill acquisition. Without these fundamental skills, an individual cannot participate effectively in a modern economy.
2.  **Development of Technical and Vocational Skills:** Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is crucial for creating a workforce with specific, job-oriented skills. It equips people to become skilled technicians, engineers, IT professionals, and craftsmen who are directly needed by industries. A country's ability to industrialize and move up the value chain depends heavily on the quality of its TVET system.
3.  **Cultivating Higher-Order Thinking and Innovation:** Higher education (universities) is essential for developing advanced knowledge, critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and research capabilities. It produces the scientists, researchers, managers, and entrepreneurs who drive innovation, develop new technologies, and create new industries, which is vital for long-term competitiveness.
4.  **Adaptability in a Changing Economy:** In today's rapidly changing global economy, continuous learning and adaptability are key. A good education system fosters a culture of lifelong learning, enabling the workforce to adapt to new technologies (like AI and automation) and evolving job market demands.
5.  **Improving Productivity:** An educated and skilled workforce is significantly more productive than an unskilled one. Skilled workers can operate complex machinery, implement efficient processes, and contribute to higher quality output, leading to overall economic growth and higher national income.

In conclusion, education is the primary investment a nation can make in its people. It is the direct pipeline for creating skilled human resources, without which a country cannot achieve sustainable socio-economic development or compete effectively in the global arena.

**(c) To what extent are the initiatives of the present government in the development of proper education? (5)**

**Answer:**
The present government of Bangladesh has taken extensive and multi-faceted initiatives to develop proper education, with a clear focus on access, quality, and relevance. The extent of these initiatives is significant, though challenges in implementation remain.

Key initiatives include:
1.  **Ensuring Access and Equity:** The government has made significant strides in ensuring access to education. It has achieved near-universal primary school enrollment and gender parity. Key initiatives include the distribution of free textbooks to all students up to the secondary level, extensive stipend programs for poor and female students, and the nationalization of thousands of primary schools.
2.  **Focus on Quality Improvement:** To improve quality, the government has focused on teacher training, curriculum modernization (based on the National Education Policy 2010), and the introduction of creative assessment methods to move away from rote learning.
3.  **Emphasis on ICT and Digital Education:** A major push has been made to integrate ICT into education. This includes establishing multimedia classrooms in schools, creating digital educational content, and training teachers in ICT skills.
4.  **Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education (TVET):** Recognizing the need for a skilled workforce, the government has put a strong emphasis on TVET, aiming to increase enrollment and modernize curricula to align with industry needs.
5.  **Expansion of Higher Education:** The government has established numerous new public universities, including specialized ones for science and technology, medicine, and textiles, to expand access to higher education across the country.

While these initiatives are extensive, the government faces significant challenges in ensuring the quality of education at all levels, addressing the teacher-student ratio, and making the curriculum fully responsive to the demands of the 4th Industrial Revolution.

### **Question 07**

**(a) Give a brief introduction to the mineral resources of Bangladesh. (5)**

**Answer:**
Bangladesh's mineral resource base is characterized by a significant endowment of non-metallic energy minerals, rather than metallic ores. The geology of the country, being a vast riverine delta, is conducive to the formation of sedimentary mineral deposits. The most important mineral resource is **natural gas**, which has historically been the primary driver of the country's energy sector and industries. Other significant resources include large deposits of high-quality **bituminous coal** in the northwest, **hard rock** (essential for construction), **limestone** and **white clay** (powering the cement and ceramics industries), and **silica sand** (for glass manufacturing). Recent exploration efforts, particularly in the offshore areas of the Bay of Bengal, hold promise for discovering new reserves of oil and gas.

**(b) What are the problems and prospects in the extraction and industrial use of our mineral resources? (10)**

**Answer:**
The extraction and industrial use of Bangladesh's mineral resources are fraught with both significant problems and immense prospects.

**Problems/Challenges:**
1.  **Technical and Technological Constraints:** The extraction of underground minerals like coal and hard rock is technologically complex and expensive. Bangladesh lacks sufficient domestic expertise and advanced technology, often relying on foreign companies. The Barapukuria coal mine, for instance, faces technical challenges and environmental concerns.
2.  **High Capital Investment:** Developing mines and gas fields requires massive capital investment, which is a major constraint for a developing country like Bangladesh.
3.  **Environmental and Social Concerns:** Mining activities, especially open-pit coal mining (as proposed for Phulbari), raise severe environmental concerns, including the degradation of agricultural land, depletion of groundwater, and air/water pollution. It can also lead to the displacement of local communities, causing social unrest.
4.  **Depletion of Gas Reserves:** The existing onshore natural gas reserves are depleting rapidly, while exploration for new reserves, especially offshore, has been slow and has not yielded major discoveries yet. This is creating an impending energy crisis.
5.  **Lack of a Comprehensive Policy:** There is a need for a more robust and clear national mineral policy to guide sustainable extraction, attract investment, and ensure environmental protection.

**Prospects/Opportunities:**
1.  **Fueling Economic Growth:** The proper utilization of domestic coal and gas can provide a more affordable and reliable source of energy for power generation and industries, reducing reliance on expensive imported LNG and fuel oil and driving economic growth.
2.  **Reducing Import Dependency:** Using domestic hard rock, limestone, and other industrial minerals reduces the import bill for construction and industrial raw materials, saving valuable foreign currency.
3.  **Offshore Potential:** The undisputed maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal holds significant untapped potential for major offshore gas and oil discoveries, which could be a game-changer for the country's energy security.
4.  **Development of Ancillary Industries:** The development of the mining sector can spur the growth of various ancillary industries and create employment opportunities in some of the less developed parts of the country.
5.  **Renewable Energy Synergy:** While exploiting fossil fuels, there is also a prospect of integrating renewable energy sources to create a more balanced and sustainable energy mix for the future.

**(c) Discuss the importance of coal as a source of energy. (5)**

**Answer:**
Coal holds significant importance as a source of energy, both globally and potentially for Bangladesh, due to several key characteristics:

1.  **Abundance and Availability:** Coal is the world's most abundant fossil fuel. For Bangladesh, the discovered reserves in the northwest represent a very large, indigenous source of energy that could last for many decades.
2.  **Cost-Effectiveness for Power Generation:** Coal is often one of the cheapest and most reliable fuels for large-scale, base-load electricity generation. Coal-fired power plants can provide a steady and affordable supply of electricity, which is essential for industrialization and economic development.
3.  **Energy Security:** Utilizing domestic coal can significantly enhance a country's energy security by reducing its dependence on the volatile international market for imported fuels like oil and LNG, thereby insulating the economy from price shocks.
4.  **Industrial Use:** Besides power generation, coal is a vital raw material for several key industries, including steel manufacturing (coking coal) and cement production.
5.  **Technological Maturity:** The technology for coal-fired power generation is mature and well-established. Modern "clean coal" technologies, such as supercritical power plants and carbon capture systems, can help mitigate some of its adverse environmental impacts, although they remain a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite its environmental drawbacks, the combination of abundance, low cost, and its role in ensuring energy security makes coal a critically important, albeit transitional, energy source for many developing countries like Bangladesh.

**(c) How much potential do you think there is for more in the ICT sector in this country in the near future? (5)**

**Answer:**
I believe the potential for further growth in the ICT sector in Bangladesh in the near future is immense. The groundwork has been laid, but the country is only beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible.

Key areas of potential include:
1.  **Moving Up the Value Chain:** The ITES industry can move beyond basic outsourcing to higher-value services like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain development. There is huge potential for Bangladesh to become a regional hub for these emerging technologies.
2.  **Deepening Financial Technology (Fintech):** The success of MFS is just the beginning. There is vast potential for digital lending, insurance (insurtech), and investment services to reach the unbanked and underbanked population.
3.  **Digital Transformation of Industries:** Traditional industries like agriculture (agri-tech), healthcare (health-tech), and manufacturing can be revolutionized by ICT, leading to massive gains in efficiency and productivity.
4.  **E-commerce and E-logistics Growth:** With increasing internet penetration and a growing middle class, the e-commerce market is poised for exponential growth. This will drive corresponding growth in the e-logistics and digital payment sectors.
5.  **The "Smart Bangladesh" Vision:** The government's new vision to build a "Smart Bangladesh" by 2041, focusing on a smart citizenry, smart government, smart economy, and smart society, will itself be a massive driver of ICT sector growth, creating demand for new technologies and skilled professionals.

Given its demographic dividend (a large, young population), increasing connectivity, and strong government support, the ICT sector has the potential to be a primary engine of Bangladesh's journey towards becoming a developed nation.

### **Question 09**

**(a) What is meant by disaster management? (5)**

**Answer:**
Disaster management is a systematic and continuous process of planning, organizing, coordinating, and implementing measures to manage and mitigate the risks and consequences associated with disasters. It is a comprehensive cycle that aims to reduce the adverse impacts of hazards on human life, property, and the environment. It is not just about responding after a disaster strikes but involves a holistic approach covering all phases. The disaster management cycle typically includes four key phases:
1.  **Mitigation:** Actions taken to prevent or reduce the long-term risk and effects of a disaster (e.g., building cyclone shelters, creating coastal embankments).
2.  **Preparedness:** Planning and preparing for a disaster before it occurs (e.g., developing early warning systems, training volunteers, stockpiling supplies).
3.  **Response:** Actions taken immediately during and after a disaster to save lives and meet the immediate needs of affected people (e.g., search and rescue, providing emergency food and shelter).
4.  **Recovery:** Actions taken after the immediate needs are met to help the community return to normalcy and rebuild (e.g., restoring infrastructure, providing psycho-social support, rebuilding livelihoods).

### **Question 10**

**Write short notes on any four of the following: (ALL are answered as requested)**

**(a) Administrative Tribunal**
An Administrative Tribunal is a specialized quasi-judicial body established under Article 117 of the Constitution of Bangladesh to adjudicate disputes related to the public service. Its primary purpose is to provide a separate, speedy, and efficient forum for resolving grievances of public servants concerning their terms and conditions of service (e.g., appointment, promotion, seniority, dismissal). This relieves the regular courts of the burden of service-related litigation. The decisions of an Administrative Tribunal can be appealed to an Administrative Appellate Tribunal, and its final judgment can be challenged only in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, not the High Court Division.

**(b) Bangladesh National Museum**
The Bangladesh National Museum, located in Shahbag, Dhaka, is the premier museum of the country. Established in 1913 (initially as the Dhaka Museum) and given its current status in 1983, it is the custodian of the nation's rich history, culture, and natural heritage. The museum has a vast and diverse collection, organized into several departments, including History and Classical Art, Ethnography and Decorative Art, and Natural History. Its galleries display thousands of artifacts, ranging from ancient archaeological finds from Wari-Bateshwar and Mahasthangarh, sculptures from the Pala and Sena periods, objects from the Mughal era, documents and artifacts from the Liberation War, and examples of the nation's folk art and natural history. It serves as a vital center for education, research, and the preservation of national identity.

**(c) Martyred Intellectuals' Day**
Martyred Intellectuals' Day is observed in Bangladesh on **December 14th** each year. It is a day of national mourning to commemorate the intellectuals—professors, doctors, journalists, artists, engineers, and writers—who were systematically abducted and brutally killed by the Pakistani army and their local collaborators (Al-Badr, Al-Shams) just two days before the final victory in the 1971 Liberation War. This calculated massacre was a heinous crime intended to cripple the new nation intellectually at its birth. On this day, people across the country pay tribute to the martyred intellectuals at memorials, most notably the Martyred Intellectuals Memorial at Rayerbazar in Dhaka, reaffirming the nation's debt to their sacrifice.

**(d) Union Health and Family Welfare Centre**
The Union Health and Family Welfare Centre (UH&FWC) is a vital government healthcare facility at the union level, the lowest administrative tier in rural Bangladesh. It is a cornerstone of the country's primary healthcare delivery system. These centers are designed to bring essential health services to the doorsteps of the rural population. They are typically staffed by a medical assistant, a pharmacist, and family welfare visitors, and provide a range of services including basic curative care, maternal and child health services, immunization programs, family planning services, and health education. They act as the first point of contact for rural people with the formal health system and are crucial for the success of national health programs like immunization and family planning.

**(e) 17 April 1971**
April 17, 1971, is a red-letter day in the history of Bangladesh. On this day, the first provisional government of Bangladesh, popularly known as the **Mujibnagar Government**, was formally inaugurated and took its oath of office. The ceremony took place at a mango grove in the village of Baidyanathtala (later renamed Mujibnagar) in Meherpur. At this ceremony, the Proclamation of Independence was formally read out, and the cabinet, with Syed Nazrul Islam as Acting President and Tajuddin Ahmad as Prime Minister, was sworn in. This event gave the Liberation War a legitimate political leadership and a constitutional basis, transforming a popular revolt into an organized, state-led war for national liberation, which was crucial for gaining international support and guiding the nation to victory.

**(f) Food Security in Bangladesh**
Food security in Bangladesh means ensuring that all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in achieving food security, particularly in terms of food availability. Thanks to a green revolution, the country has achieved self-sufficiency in rice production. However, challenges remain in the other dimensions of food security. While food is available, ensuring **access** (affordability for the poor) and **nutrition** (diversifying diets beyond rice to include more protein, fruits, and vegetables) are ongoing priorities for the government. The country also remains vulnerable to climate change-induced production shocks, which can threaten food security.

**(g) Our Marine Resources**
"Our Marine Resources" refers to the wealth of living and non-living resources available to Bangladesh within its maritime boundaries in the Bay of Bengal. Following the successful resolution of maritime disputes with Myanmar and India, Bangladesh gained sovereign rights over a vast sea area of 118,813 square kilometers. These resources form the basis of the country's "Blue Economy." Key marine resources include:
*   **Living Resources:** Rich fisheries, including the iconic Hilsa fish, shrimp, and numerous other species that are vital for national nutrition and export earnings.
*   **Non-Living Resources:** Potentially vast reserves of offshore **natural gas and oil**. Other resources include valuable heavy minerals in sea-sand, such as zircon and ilmenite.
*   **Other Resources:** The sea also offers opportunities for developing maritime trade (ports), tourism, shipbuilding, and harnessing renewable energy (offshore wind). Sustainable management of these marine resources is critical for Bangladesh's future economic growth.
