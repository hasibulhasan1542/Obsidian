### **Question 01**

**(a) Describe the geographical location and physiography of Bangladesh. (10)**

**Answer:**

**Geographical Location:**
Bangladesh is strategically situated in the northeastern part of the South Asian subcontinent.
*   **Coordinates:** It lies between 20°34' and 26°38' north latitude and 88°01' and 92°41' east longitude.
*   **Boundaries:** The country is bordered by India on its west, north, and east sides, creating an extensive land border of 4,096 km. It shares a smaller border of 271 km with Myanmar to its southeast. To the south lies the Bay of Bengal, providing a 580 km coastline and vital maritime access.
*   **Position:** Its location makes it a physical bridge between the vast regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia.

**Physiography (Geo-nature):**
The physiography of Bangladesh is dominated by the vast Bengal Delta, but it can be broadly classified into three main regions:

1.  **Tertiary Hills:** These are the oldest and highest lands in Bangladesh, formed during the Tertiary geological period. They account for about 12% of the country's land area and are found in two distinct areas:
    *   **The Southeastern Hills:** Located in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (Rangamati, Khagrachhari, Bandarban) and Cox's Bazar, these hills are part of the Arakan Yoma mountain range. They consist of several parallel ranges running north-south, with peaks like Keokradong and Tazing Dong reaching over 1,000 meters.
    *   **The Northeastern Hills:** These are low, isolated hills and hillocks in the Sylhet region, such as the Khasia and Jaintia hills.

2.  **Pleistocene Terraces:** These are slightly elevated, older alluvial plains formed during the Pleistocene epoch. They cover about 8% of the land area and are generally flood-free. There are two main terrace areas:
    *   **The Barind Tract:** Located in the northwestern part of the country (Rajshahi, Bogura, Dinajpur), it is an undulating area with reddish, clay-rich soil.
    *   **The Madhupur Tract:** Located in the central region (Dhaka, Gazipur, Tangail), it is a large, elevated tract of land.

3.  **Recent Floodplains:** This is the most extensive physiographic unit, covering about 80% of Bangladesh. It is a vast, low-lying, and exceptionally fertile plain formed by the silt deposited by the three mighty river systems—the Ganges (Padma), the Brahmaputra (Jamuna), and the Meghna. This region is a dynamic landscape of active river channels, chars (river islands), and vast floodplains that are inundated annually during the monsoon, which replenishes the soil's fertility.

**(b) Discuss the strategic location of Bangladesh in geo-politics and its risks. (10)**

**Answer:**
Bangladesh's strategic location is a double-edged sword, offering significant geopolitical opportunities while also exposing it to considerable risks.

**Strategic Importance:**
1.  **Maritime Gateway:** Bangladesh's position on the Bay of Bengal, at the apex of the Indian Ocean, makes it a critical maritime nation. Its ports provide a natural sea outlet for its landlocked neighbors (Nepal, Bhutan) and the landlocked northeastern states of India.
2.  **Bridge between South and Southeast Asia:** It physically connects the two dynamic regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. This makes it a crucial node for regional and trans-national connectivity projects (e.g., BIMSTEC, BBIN), enhancing its geopolitical leverage.
3.  **Focal Point of Great Power Interest:** Its location has become a focal point in the great power competition in the Indo-Pacific region. Major powers like the USA, China, India, and Japan all have significant strategic and economic interests in Bangladesh, providing it with opportunities to attract investment and diplomatic support.

**Risks and Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **The "Sandwich" Dilemma:** Being "sandwiched" between India and Myanmar, and in close proximity to China, creates a complex security environment. The most significant risk is being caught in the escalating rivalry between its two giant neighbors, India and China. Maintaining a neutral and balanced foreign policy is a constant diplomatic challenge.
2.  **Trans-national Security Threats:** Its long and porous borders make it vulnerable to various trans-national security threats, including illegal migration, drug trafficking (especially Yaba from Myanmar), human trafficking, and the movement of insurgents and terrorists.
3.  **The Rohingya Crisis:** The influx of over a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar has created a massive security, economic, and environmental burden. The failure to repatriate them poses a long-term risk of instability in the southeastern region.
4.  **Climate Change Vulnerability:** As a low-lying delta, its strategic location is also its greatest physical vulnerability. Sea-level rise, a direct consequence of global geopolitics of climate change, poses an existential threat to the country's territory and population.
5.  **Pressure from Major Powers:** While the interest of major powers brings benefits, it also brings pressure. Bangladesh faces constant diplomatic pressure to align with competing strategic initiatives (e.g., China's Belt and Road Initiative vs. the US-led Indo-Pacific Strategy), which risks compromising its foreign policy independence.

### **Question 02**

**(a) What is meant by 'family planning'? (3)**

**Answer:**
Family planning refers to the conscious and voluntary practice by individuals and couples to control the number of children they have and the intervals between their births. It is achieved through the use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of infertility. The core objective of family planning is not just to limit population growth, but to improve the health and well-being of mothers and children, empower individuals (especially women) with reproductive choices, and contribute to overall family and national development.

**(b) Describe the steps taken by the Bangladesh government to control population. (7)**

**Answer:**
The Government of Bangladesh has implemented a comprehensive and sustained program to control population growth, which is recognized globally as a major success story. The key steps are:

1.  **Nationwide Service Delivery Network:** The government established a vast network of healthcare facilities, from community clinics at the grassroots to Union Health and Family Welfare Centres and Upazila Health Complexes, to make family planning services and contraceptives widely accessible, even in remote rural areas.
2.  **Field Worker Program:** A large cadre of female field workers, known as Family Welfare Assistants (FWAs), was created. These workers go door-to-door to counsel women, provide contraceptives, and build trust within the community, which was crucial in overcoming social and cultural barriers.
3.  **Wide Range of Contraceptive Choices:** The program offers a wide range of free or highly subsidized contraceptive methods (the "cafeteria approach"), including pills, condoms, injectables, implants, and permanent methods, allowing couples to choose the method best suited for them.
4.  **Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) Campaigns:** The government has used mass media (radio, television) and community-level communication extensively to raise awareness about the benefits of small families and the availability of family planning services.
5.  **Integration with Maternal and Child Health:** Family planning has been successfully integrated with maternal and child health (MCH) services. This holistic approach has improved the health outcomes for both mothers and children, making the program more attractive to families.
6.  **Empowerment of Women:** Government policies promoting girls' education and women's participation in the workforce (e.g., in the RMG sector) have been crucial indirect factors. Empowered and educated women tend to have fewer children and make more informed reproductive choices.
7.  **Public-Private and NGO Partnership:** The government has actively collaborated with NGOs (like BRAC) and the private sector to supplement its service delivery and outreach efforts, significantly expanding the program's reach.

**(c) Describe the success of the measures taken to control the human population in Bangladesh and its contribution to the economy. (10)**

**Answer:**
The success of Bangladesh's population control measures has been remarkable and has made a profound contribution to its economic development.

**Success of the Measures:**
*   **Drastic Reduction in Fertility Rate:** The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) – the average number of children born to a woman – has fallen dramatically from around 6.3 in the 1970s to approximately 2.0 today, which is below the replacement level. This is a phenomenal achievement for a developing country.
*   **Increased Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR):** The CPR has increased from less than 8% in 1975 to over 63% currently, indicating widespread adoption of family planning methods.
*   **Reduced Population Growth Rate:** Consequently, the annual population growth rate has been brought down from over 2.7% to around 1.1%.

**Contribution to the Economy:**
1.  **Enabling the "Demographic Dividend":** By reducing the fertility rate, the population program changed the country's age structure, creating a "demographic dividend." This means there is now a larger proportion of working-age people compared to dependents (children and the elderly). This large workforce has been a key engine of Bangladesh's economic growth, supplying labor for industries like RMG.
2.  **Increased Per Capita Income:** Slower population growth has meant that the benefits of economic growth are shared among fewer people, leading to a faster increase in per capita income and living standards.
3.  **Reduced Pressure on Public Services:** A smaller population of dependents reduces the strain on public services like education, healthcare, and housing, allowing the government to invest more per capita and improve the quality of these services.
4.  **Improved Human Capital:** Smaller family sizes allow parents to invest more in the health and education of each child, leading to a healthier and better-educated future workforce, which in turn boosts economic productivity.
5.  **Empowerment of Women:** By giving women control over their fertility, family planning has empowered them to pursue education and employment, contributing directly to the national economy and household income.

In essence, the success of the population control program was a critical prerequisite for Bangladesh's subsequent economic takeoff.

### **Question 03**

**Mention the different phases of the background of the struggle for independence of Bangladesh from 1947 to 1971. (20)**

**Answer:**
The struggle for the independence of Bangladesh was a long, arduous, and phased journey of political awakening and nationalist assertion against the colonial-style domination by West Pakistan. The background from 1947 to 1971 can be divided into distinct phases, each building upon the last, culminating in the Liberation War.

**Phase I: The Struggle for Cultural and Linguistic Identity (1947-1954)**
*   **The First Betrayal:** Immediately after the partition of India in 1947, the Bengalis of East Pakistan, who constituted the majority of Pakistan's population, faced a cultural assault. The central government, dominated by West Pakistanis, declared Urdu as the sole state language.
*   **The Language Movement:** This led to a spontaneous protest movement, spearheaded by the students of Dhaka University. The struggle reached its peak on **February 21, 1952**, when police opened fire on a student procession, killing several protesters (Salam, Barkat, Rafiq, Jabbar, and others).
*   **Significance:** This phase was crucial as it established that Bengali identity was rooted in language and culture, not just religion. It sowed the first seeds of Bengali nationalism and exposed the colonial mindset of the West Pakistani ruling elite. The movement's success in forcing the government to grant Bengali the status of a state language in 1956 was the first major victory.

**Phase II: The Struggle for Democratic and Economic Rights (1954-1966)**
*   **Political Assertion:** The Bengalis asserted their political will in the **1954 provincial election**. A coalition of opposition parties, the **United Front**, led by A. K. Fazlul Huq, H. S. Suhrawardy, and Maulana Bhashani, inflicted a crushing defeat on the ruling Muslim League. However, the elected government was unjustly dismissed by the central government shortly after.
*   **Economic Disparity:** This period was marked by systematic economic exploitation. Jute, the primary export of East Pakistan, earned the bulk of the country's foreign exchange, but the revenue was disproportionately spent on developing West Pakistan. This created a huge economic disparity and a deep sense of grievance.
*   **The Six-Point Program:** In **1966**, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the Awami League, presented his historic **Six-Point Program**. This was a charter for radical autonomy, demanding a federal system, separate currencies, and control over taxation and foreign trade for East Pakistan. It was hailed as the *Muktir Sanad* (Charter of Freedom) for the Bengalis.

**Phase III: The Rise of Mass Nationalism and Confrontation (1966-1969)**
*   **Repression and Resistance:** The Pakistani regime, under the military dictator Ayub Khan, saw the Six-Point Program as a secessionist plot. They arrested Sheikh Mujib and other Bengali leaders and filed the infamous **Agartala Conspiracy Case** in 1968, accusing them of treason.
*   **The 1969 Mass Uprising (*Gono Obbhyutthan*):** The trial of Sheikh Mujib sparked a massive, spontaneous popular uprising across East Pakistan. Students, workers, and peasants united in protest. The movement forced the Ayub regime to withdraw the case, release Sheikh Mujib unconditionally, and ultimately led to the downfall of Ayub Khan himself.
*   **Significance:** This phase radicalized Bengali politics, solidified Sheikh Mujib's position as the undisputed "Bangabandhu" (Friend of Bengal), and made the demand for autonomy non-negotiable.

**Phase IV: The Final Political Confrontation (1970 - March 1971)**
*   **The 1970 General Election:** The new military ruler, General Yahya Khan, was forced to hold Pakistan's first-ever general election based on universal franchise. The Awami League contested on the platform of the Six-Points and won a historic landslide victory, securing 167 out of 169 seats in East Pakistan, which gave it an absolute majority in the all-Pakistan National Assembly.
*   **Denial of the Mandate:** The West Pakistani establishment, led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the military junta, refused to accept the election results and transfer power to the Awami League.
*   **The Path to War:** This refusal led to the final breakdown. Bangabandhu launched a non-cooperation movement in March 1971, effectively taking control of East Pakistan. His **historic speech on March 7, 1971**, was a de facto declaration of independence, where he famously said, "This time the struggle is for our freedom, this time the struggle is for our independence."

The final phase was the genocidal crackdown by the Pakistani army on the night of March 25, 1971, which triggered the armed Liberation War.

### **Question 04**

**Describe the impact of the following events in the struggle for independence of Bangladesh: (5x4=20)**

**(a) The Six-Point Movement**
The Six-Point Movement of 1966 was the political turning point in Bangladesh's struggle for independence. Presented by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, it was a constitutional formula for radical autonomy to end the economic exploitation and political domination by West Pakistan.
*   **Impact:** It provided a clear, concrete political and economic roadmap for the Bengali people. It galvanized the entire nation, moving the demand from vague grievances to a specific charter of rights. The Pakistani regime's violent rejection of the Six-Points and the subsequent arrest of Sheikh Mujib only strengthened the resolve of the Bengalis and solidified the program's status as the sole path to survival, effectively laying the ideological groundwork for a separate state.

**(b) The '69 Mass Uprising**
The 1969 Mass Uprising (*Gono Obbhyutthan*) was a powerful, spontaneous eruption of popular will against the decade-long military dictatorship of Ayub Khan, triggered by the Agartala Conspiracy Case against Sheikh Mujib.
*   **Impact:** Its impact was immediate and decisive. It forced the regime to withdraw the conspiracy case and release Sheikh Mujib, who emerged as the undisputed national hero, "Bangabandhu." More importantly, it led to the downfall of the powerful dictator Ayub Khan, demonstrating the power of the people. It compelled the new military regime to concede to the demand for a general election based on one-person-one-vote, which set the stage for the 1970 election.

**(c) The 1970 General Election**
The 1970 General Election was the final, non-violent chapter in the struggle. It functioned as a democratic referendum on the Six-Point Program.
*   **Impact:** The Awami League's landslide victory, winning an absolute majority in the Pakistan National Assembly, gave the Bengali cause an undeniable democratic and constitutional legitimacy. It legally established Sheikh Mujib as the majority leader of Pakistan. The subsequent refusal of the West Pakistani establishment to honor this massive popular mandate was the final act of betrayal that destroyed any hope for a united Pakistan and provided the moral and legal justification for declaring independence.

**(d) The 7th March Speech**
Delivered by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on March 7, 1971, at the Ramna Race Course, this speech is one of the most important in modern history (and a UNESCO recognized heritage). It was delivered at a time of extreme political tension after the postponement of the National Assembly session.
*   **Impact:** The speech was a strategic masterpiece. It was a de facto declaration of independence and a call to arms, while skillfully avoiding a unilateral declaration that could have been used by the Pakistani regime to label him a secessionist. It provided the Bengali nation with a clear set of instructions for a civil disobedience movement and prepared them for the imminent armed struggle. The concluding line, "This time the struggle is for our freedom, this time the struggle is for our independence," became the clarion call for the Liberation War.

### **Question 05**

**(a) How is EPZ (Export Processing Zone) playing a role in the industrialization of Bangladesh? (10)**

**Answer:**
Export Processing Zones (EPZs) have played a pioneering and profoundly significant role in the industrialization of Bangladesh, particularly in kick-starting its export-oriented growth model. EPZs are special industrial enclaves that offer a package of infrastructure facilities and incentives to attract foreign and local investment for export-oriented production.

Their role can be highlighted as follows:
1.  **Attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):** EPZs have been the primary vehicle for attracting FDI into Bangladesh's manufacturing sector. They offer investors a secure and hassle-free environment with benefits like tax holidays, duty-free import of raw materials and machinery, and simplified administrative procedures. This has brought in crucial foreign capital and technology.
2.  **Spearheading the RMG Revolution:** The EPZs were the cradle of Bangladesh's Ready-Made Garment (RMG) industry. The first factories, often joint ventures with foreign companies from countries like South Korea and Hong Kong, were established in the Chittagong EPZ. These factories introduced modern production techniques and access to international markets, which later spread to the rest of the country.
3.  **Employment Generation:** EPZs are major centers of employment, having created jobs for hundreds of thousands of workers, a majority of whom are women. This has not only contributed to poverty reduction but has also been a major driver of female empowerment.
4.  **Export Growth and Diversification:** While dominated by RMG, EPZs have also helped to diversify Bangladesh's export basket by promoting investment in other sectors like footwear, leather goods, electronics, and agro-processing industries. They contribute a significant portion of the country's total export earnings.
5.  **Linkage Effects and Skill Transfer:** EPZs have created backward linkage effects, stimulating the growth of local industries that supply raw materials and services to the factories within the zones. They have also been a crucial channel for the transfer of modern management techniques, technical skills, and knowledge of international quality standards to the local workforce.
6.  **"Demonstration Effect":** The success of the EPZ model demonstrated to both local and international investors that Bangladesh could be a competitive location for manufacturing, thereby encouraging investment outside the zones as well.

**(b) What is the difference between Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) and Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA)? (5)**

**Answer:**
While both BEZA and BEPZA are government authorities established to promote industrialization through special zones, they have different scopes, mandates, and operational models.

| Basis of Difference | **BEPZA (Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority)** | **BEZA (Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | **Exclusively export-oriented.** 100% of the production from factories within an EPZ must be exported (with some minor exceptions). | **Both export and domestic markets.** Industries in an EZ can sell their products in both international and domestic markets. |
| **Establishment Law** | Established under the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority Act, 1980. | Established under the Bangladesh Economic Zones Act, 2010. It is a more recent initiative. |
| **Operational Model** | **Direct development and management.** BEPZA itself acquires the land, develops the infrastructure (roads, utilities), and directly manages the EPZs as a public entity. | **Primarily a facilitator and regulator.** BEZA's model is based on Public-Private Partnership (PPP). It identifies locations and then invites private developers (local or foreign) to build and operate the Economic Zones under a license from BEZA. |
| **Scope of Industries** | Traditionally focused on a few key sectors like garments, textiles, and footwear. | Aims to attract a much wider and more diverse range of industries, including heavy industries, automotive, pharmaceuticals, IT, and agro-processing. |
| **Geographical Scope** | Manages 8 specific, geographically contained public EPZs in locations like Dhaka, Chittagong, etc. | Has a much broader mandate to establish **100 Economic Zones** across the country by 2030, through public, private, or PPP models. |

In essence, BEPZA created the successful export-oriented model, while BEZA is the next-generation evolution of this concept, designed to be much larger in scale, broader in scope, and more reliant on private sector participation to accelerate the country's industrialization.

**(c) What are the various projects completed so far under PPP (Public-Private Partnership)? (5)**

**Answer:**
Under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, the Government of Bangladesh has initiated a large number of projects across various sectors to bridge its infrastructure financing gap. While many are in different stages of construction or planning, several key projects have been completed or have reached significant operational milestones.

Notable examples include:
1.  **Dhaka Elevated Expressway:** This is a flagship PPP project. The first phase of the expressway, from the Airport road to Farmgate, has been completed and was inaugurated in September 2023, significantly easing traffic congestion in one of Dhaka's busiest corridors. The rest of the project is under construction.
2.  **Independent Power Plants (IPPs):** The power sector has been the most successful area for PPPs in Bangladesh. Numerous IPPs, which are power plants built and operated by private companies that sell electricity to the government grid, have been completed and are operational. Examples include plants operated by Summit Group, United Group, and Orion Group.
3.  **Specialized Hospital Projects:** The government has engaged in PPP projects for specialized health services. An early example is the National Institute of Kidney Diseases & Urology's hemodialysis center, which is operated in partnership with a private entity to provide affordable services.
4.  **Economic Zones Development:** Many of the new Economic Zones under BEZA are being developed through PPP. For example, the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Shilpa Nagar includes zones developed by private conglomerates like Bashundhara Group and Summit Group.
5.  **Third Terminal of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport:** While not a classic PPP in terms of private financing for the entire construction (it was financed by JICA), its operational management is planned to be handed over to a private international operator on a PPP basis. The "soft opening" of the terminal occurred in October 2023.

These projects demonstrate the government's increasing reliance on the PPP model to deliver large-scale, modern infrastructure and services.

Of course. Here are the detailed answers for the remaining questions (06 to 10) from the fifth set of images, following the same structured and analytical approach.

### **Question 06**

**(a) Describe the fundamental principles of the Bangladesh Constitution. (5)**

**Answer:**
The Constitution of Bangladesh is built upon four fundamental principles of state policy, which are enshrined in Part II of the document. These principles, restored by the 15th Amendment, form the ideological bedrock of the republic. They are:

1.  **Nationalism (Article 9):** The Constitution defines this as Bengali Nationalism, based on the unity and solidarity of the Bengali nation, which achieved independence through a national liberation struggle. It is rooted in the shared language, culture, and history of the people.
2.  **Socialism (Article 10):** This principle is interpreted as the establishment of an egalitarian society, free from exploitation. The aim is to achieve economic and social justice through planned economic development and equitable distribution of wealth.
3.  **Democracy (Article 11):** This principle guarantees a system of governance where fundamental human rights are secured, and effective participation of the people through their elected representatives is ensured at all levels of administration.
4.  **Secularism (Article 12):** This principle mandates the elimination of communalism, prohibits the state from granting political status to any religion, forbids the abuse of religion for political purposes, and ensures freedom from religious discrimination.

**(b) Describe the provisions for the amendment of the Constitution of Bangladesh. (5)**

**Answer:**
The provisions for amending the Constitution of Bangladesh are laid out in **Article 142** of the document. The process is designed to be rigorous, reflecting the supremacy of the Constitution.

The key provisions are:
1.  **Introduction of a Bill:** An amendment can only be initiated by introducing a Bill for this purpose in the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament).
2.  **Special Majority Requirement:** For an amendment Bill to be passed, it requires the votes of **not less than two-thirds** of the total number of members of Parliament. This is a special majority, much higher than the simple majority required for ordinary laws.
3.  **President's Assent:** After being passed by Parliament with the required two-thirds majority, the Bill is presented to the President for assent. The President must give his assent to the Bill within seven days. Unlike ordinary bills, the President cannot veto an amendment bill or send it back for reconsideration.
4.  **Limitation on Amendment (Basic Structure Doctrine):** While Article 142 provides the procedure, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has established the "Basic Structure Doctrine." This doctrine holds that Parliament, while having the power to amend, cannot alter or destroy the fundamental features or "basic structure" of the Constitution (e.g., democracy, separation of powers, judicial independence, fundamental rights). The 15th Amendment itself inserted Article 7B, which explicitly lists certain provisions as unamendable.

**(c) Describe the main features of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh. (10)**

**Answer:**
The Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 2011, is one of the most significant and wide-ranging amendments in Bangladesh's history. It was enacted based on a Supreme Court verdict that declared the 5th Amendment illegal and on the recommendations of a special parliamentary committee.

The main features are:
1.  **Abolition of the Caretaker Government System:** Its most controversial feature was the repeal of the non-partisan Caretaker Government system, which was introduced by the 13th Amendment to oversee general elections. The 15th Amendment restored the system of holding elections under the incumbent government.
2.  **Restoration of the 1972 Constitution's Principles:** It fully restored the four original fundamental principles of state policy from the 1972 Constitution: Nationalism, Socialism, Democracy, and Secularism. Article 12 on Secularism was reinstated.
3.  **Incorporation of Historical Documents:** It gave constitutional status to the Proclamation of Independence of April 10, 1971, and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's historic 7th March Speech by incorporating them into the Constitution as schedules.
4.  **Recognition of the Father of the Nation:** The amendment constitutionally recognized Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation.
5.  **Strengthening Constitutional Supremacy:** It inserted Article 7B, which makes the basic provisions of the Constitution (such as the Preamble, fundamental principles, fundamental rights, and the republican form of government) unamendable, thereby codifying the "basic structure" doctrine into the Constitution itself.
6.  **Recognition of Small Ethnic Groups:** It added Article 23A, which mandates the state to protect and develop the unique culture and tradition of the country's small ethnic groups.
7.  **Increase in Reserved Seats for Women:** The number of reserved seats for women in the Jatiya Sangsad was increased from 45 to 50.

### **Question 07**

**(a) What is meant by war crimes? (5)**

**Answer:**
War crimes are grave breaches of the laws and customs of war, as established in international humanitarian law, particularly the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Conventions. These are violations of the established rules of armed conflict committed by individuals, whether military personnel or civilians.

War crimes include, but are not limited to:
*   **Willful killing, torture, or inhuman treatment of prisoners of war or civilians.**
*   **Wanton destruction of cities, towns, or villages not justified by military necessity.**
*   **Attacking or bombarding undefended towns or buildings.**
*   **Taking of hostages.**
*   **The use of prohibited weapons (like chemical or biological weapons).**
*   **Sexual violence, including rape and enforced prostitution, as a weapon of war.**

War crimes are distinct from "crimes against peace" (the crime of aggression) and "crimes against humanity" (widespread or systematic attacks against a civilian population), although these crimes often overlap. Individuals can be held personally accountable for committing war crimes before international tribunals like the International Criminal Court (ICC) or domestic tribunals like the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) of Bangladesh.

**(b) After discussing the war crimes committed in Bangladesh, describe the significance of the trial of war criminals. (10)**

**Answer:**

**War Crimes Committed in Bangladesh (1971):**
During the 1971 Liberation War, the Pakistani army and their local collaborators (Razakars, Al-Badr, Al-Shams) committed heinous crimes that fall under the international definitions of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. These included:
*   **Genocide:** The systematic killing of an estimated three million Bengalis, with a clear intent to destroy a part of the Bengali national group.
*   **Crimes Against Humanity:** Widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population, including mass murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and torture. A horrific campaign of mass rape was used as a weapon of war against an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 Bengali women.
*   **War Crimes:** The willful killing of unarmed civilians and prisoners of war, and the targeted assassination of intellectuals, doctors, and journalists, especially in the final days of the war.

**Significance of the Trial of War Criminals:**
The trial of these war criminals, initiated by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) of Bangladesh in 2010, holds profound significance for the nation:
1.  **Ensuring Justice for Victims:** The primary significance is delivering long-overdue justice to the millions of victims and their families. For decades, the perpetrators roamed free, and the trials provided a formal, legal recognition of the suffering of the victims.
2.  **Ending the Culture of Impunity:** The trials were crucial for ending the culture of impunity that had protected the perpetrators for nearly 40 years. By holding powerful individuals accountable, the trials established the principle that no one is above the law, strengthening the rule of law in the country.
3.  **National Healing and Reconciliation:** While controversial, the trials are seen by many as a necessary step for national healing. By officially documenting the atrocities and bringing the perpetrators to justice, the process helps to address a deep historical trauma and allows the nation to move forward.
4.  **Establishing the Historical Truth:** The trial proceedings have created a vast, legally verified archive of evidence and testimonies about the 1971 genocide. This serves as an official record of the historical truth, combating denial and distortion of the history of the Liberation War for future generations.
5.  **Fulfilling a National Pledge:** The trial of war criminals was one of the fundamental pledges made to the nation during the Liberation War. Fulfilling this pledge was seen as a moral and political imperative to honor the sacrifice of the martyrs and uphold the founding values of the nation.

**(c) What reaction has been seen in the investigation of criminal cases after the formation of 'PBI'? Discuss with examples. (5)**

**Answer:**
The formation of the **Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI)** in 2012 has brought a significant and positive reaction in the investigation of criminal cases in Bangladesh. The PBI was created as a specialized unit of the Bangladesh Police to investigate complex, sensational, and 'clusless' cases that require specialized skills and modern technology.

**Reaction and Impact:**
The PBI has earned a reputation for professionalism, technological proficiency, and success in solving cases that were previously considered unsolvable or had been poorly investigated by local police.
*   **Enhanced Public Trust:** The PBI's success in cracking high-profile cases has significantly enhanced public trust in the police's investigative capabilities. When the PBI takes charge of an investigation, there is a general public perception that the case will be handled more competently and impartially.
*   **Use of Modern Technology:** The PBI has been a pioneer within the police force in the use of forensic science, DNA profiling, digital forensics, and data analysis, leading to more evidence-based investigations and higher conviction rates.
*   **Solving Cold Cases:** The PBI has successfully reopened and solved numerous "cold cases" that had been dormant for years.

**Examples:**
1.  **Sagar-Runi Murder Case:** Although the final mystery remains unsolved, the PBI's takeover of this sensational case from other agencies was seen as a positive step, and their use of DNA analysis from a US lab demonstrated a commitment to using modern forensic techniques.
2.  **Mitu Murder Case (Chattogram):** The PBI's investigation into the murder of the wife of a former Superintendent of Police, Mahmuda Khanam Mitu, was a landmark. After the initial investigation stalled, the PBI took over and, through a meticulous investigation, implicated the husband himself, leading to a major breakthrough in a case that had gripped the nation. This showed their ability to investigate complex cases impartially, even when they involve powerful individuals.

The formation of the PBI represents a major step towards modernizing criminal investigation in Bangladesh, leading to better outcomes and increased public confidence.

### **Question 08**

**(a) What is leadership? (5)**

**Answer:**
Leadership is the art and process of influencing a group of people to work willingly and enthusiastically towards the achievement of a common goal. It is not merely about holding a position of authority or command; rather, it is about inspiring, motivating, and guiding others.

Key elements of leadership include:
*   **Vision:** A leader has a clear and compelling vision of the future and can articulate it in a way that inspires others.
*   **Influence:** Leadership is exercised through influence, not coercion. A leader persuades others to follow them voluntarily.
*   **Motivation:** A leader understands the needs and motivations of their followers and creates an environment where they feel empowered to contribute their best efforts.
*   **Decision-Making:** Leaders are responsible for making difficult decisions, often under pressure, and taking responsibility for the outcomes.
*   **Communication:** Effective communication is the lifeblood of leadership. A leader must be able to communicate their vision, goals, and instructions clearly and listen to the feedback of their team.

~~**(b) Discuss the 'charismatic' leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. (15)**~~

~~**Answer:**~~
~~Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's leadership was quintessentially "charismatic." Charismatic leadership, as defined by sociologist Max Weber, is a type of authority based on the leader's exceptional personal qualities, their ability to inspire devotion, and their perceived superhuman or heroic traits. Bangabandhu embodied these qualities, which enabled him to unite and mobilize the entire Bengali nation.~~

~~His charismatic leadership can be discussed through several key aspects:~~

1.  ~~**Unparalleled Oratorical Skill:** Bangabandhu was a master orator. His voice, tone, and powerful rhetoric could mesmerize and electrify vast crowds. His speeches, delivered in his native Bengali dialect, connected with the masses on a deeply emotional level. The historic **7th March Speech** is the ultimate testament to this power, where he single-handedly prepared a nation for war with his words.~~
2.  ~~**Unshakable Courage and Self-Sacrifice:** His personal courage was legendary. He spent nearly 13 years of his political life in prison, facing the constant threat of execution. He never compromised on the rights of the Bengali people, even when offered power and position. This willingness to sacrifice his own freedom and life for his people created an aura of invincibility and earned him their absolute trust and devotion.~~
3.  ~~**Deep Empathy and Connection with the People:** Bangabandhu possessed a profound empathy for the common people. He traveled extensively across Bengal, listening to their grievances and speaking their language. The people saw him not as a distant politician, but as one of their own—their "Mujib Bhai," and later their "Bangabandhu" (Friend of Bengal). This deep personal connection was the foundation of his charisma.~~
4.  ~~**A Compelling and Unifying Vision:** He was able to articulate a simple yet powerful vision: the dream of a "Shonar Bangla" (Golden Bengal), a sovereign and exploitation-free nation for the Bengali people. This vision united people from all walks of life—students, workers, peasants, and the middle class—under a single banner and a single leader.~~
5.  ~~**Symbol of National Identity:** Over time, Sheikh Mujib became the living embodiment of Bengali nationalism. His identity and the identity of the Bengali nation became inseparable. His voice was the voice of the 75 million Bengalis. This symbolic power is the hallmark of a true charismatic leader, whose authority transcends formal political structures and rests on the unconditional love and loyalty of his followers.~~

~~It was this unique combination of courage, sacrifice, empathy, and visionary communication that made Bangabandhu's leadership charismatic and enabled him to lead his people to independence.~~

### **Question 09**

**(a) Discuss the role of the agriculture sector in the economic development of Bangladesh. (10)**

**Answer:**
The agriculture sector has historically been and continues to be the bedrock of Bangladesh's economy, playing a pivotal role in its socio-economic development. While its share of the GDP has declined with the rise of the industrial and service sectors, its importance remains immense.

The role of the agriculture sector can be discussed as follows:
1.  **Ensuring Food Security:** The most critical role of agriculture is to feed the nation's large population. Through the adoption of modern technology, high-yield crop varieties, and irrigation, Bangladesh has achieved self-sufficiency in rice production, a monumental achievement that ensures national food security and social stability.
2.  **Major Source of Employment:** Agriculture is still the largest source of employment in Bangladesh, providing livelihoods for around 40% of the country's labor force. It is the primary source of income for the vast majority of the rural population.
3.  **Poverty Reduction:** Growth in the agricultural sector has a direct and powerful impact on poverty reduction. Increased agricultural productivity leads to higher rural incomes, lower food prices, and increased employment, which have been key drivers in lifting millions out of poverty.
4.  **Supplier of Raw Materials to Industry:** Agriculture provides essential raw materials for many of the country's industries. This includes jute for the jute industry, sugarcane for sugar mills, leather for the leather industry, and various products for the rapidly growing agro-processing industry.
5.  **Contribution to GDP and Export Earnings:** While its direct share of GDP has decreased to around 12-13%, the sector's indirect contribution is much larger. Agricultural products like frozen fish, shrimp, vegetables, and processed foods are also significant sources of export earnings.
6.  **Creating a Market for Industrial Goods:** A prosperous rural economy creates a large domestic market for industrial goods (like fertilizers, pesticides, machinery) and consumer goods, stimulating overall economic growth.

**(b) Describe the measures taken by the Bangladesh government for the development of agriculture and the improvement of the farmers' standard of living, and the success of these measures. (10)**

**Answer:**
The Government of Bangladesh has consistently prioritized the development of agriculture and the welfare of farmers, implementing a range of supportive measures that have yielded significant success.

**Measures Taken by the Government:**
1.  **Input Subsidies:** The government provides substantial subsidies on key agricultural inputs to reduce production costs for farmers. This includes subsidies on fertilizers, seeds, and electricity for irrigation.
2.  **Agricultural Research and Extension:** The government has invested heavily in agricultural research through institutions like the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) and the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). These institutions have developed numerous high-yield, saline-tolerant, and flood-tolerant crop varieties. Agricultural extension services work to disseminate this new knowledge and technology to farmers at the field level.
3.  **Access to Credit:** The government has expanded access to agricultural credit at low-interest rates through state-owned banks like the Bangladesh Krishi Bank and other commercial banks to ensure farmers have the capital to invest in their farms.
4.  **Infrastructure Development:** The government has invested in rural infrastructure, including irrigation facilities, storage facilities (silos), and rural roads, which helps farmers to increase production and get their products to market more easily.
5.  **Fair Price and Procurement:** The government runs a food procurement program where it buys paddy and rice directly from farmers at a pre-determined minimum support price, aiming to ensure they receive a fair price for their produce, especially after a harvest.

**Success of these Measures:**
The success of these measures has been remarkable and is evident in several key outcomes:
*   **Achievement of Food Self-Sufficiency:** The most significant success is the achievement of self-sufficiency in the staple food, rice. Production has more than tripled since independence.
*   **Crop Diversification:** There has been significant success in diversifying crop production beyond rice to include maize, wheat, potatoes, and various vegetables, leading to increased farm income and improved nutrition.
*   **Increased Productivity:** The adoption of high-yield varieties and modern farming techniques has led to a significant increase in land productivity.
*   **Improved Farmer Livelihoods:** While challenges remain, these measures have collectively contributed to a significant increase in rural incomes and a drastic reduction in rural poverty, improving the overall standard of living for millions of farmers.

### **Question 10**

**Write short notes on any four of the following: (ALL are answered as requested)**

**(a) Vision-2021**
Vision-2021 was a long-term national development plan announced by the Government of Bangladesh in 2008. Its central goal was to transform Bangladesh into a middle-income country and a "Digital Bangladesh" by the year 2021, which marked the 50th anniversary of the nation's independence. The vision was implemented through two consecutive Five-Year Plans (6th and 7th). Its key pillars included achieving high economic growth, alleviating poverty, promoting digitalization in all sectors, ensuring energy security, and establishing good governance. The vision successfully guided the nation to achieve most of its major targets, including graduating from the UN's Least Developed Country (LDC) category and achieving significant progress in social and economic indicators.

**(b) Resolution of the Enclave Problem**
The resolution of the enclave problem refers to the historic exchange of enclaves (*chhitmahal*) between Bangladesh and India. This ended a 68-year-old humanitarian crisis for over 50,000 stateless people. The problem was resolved through the implementation of the 1974 Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) and its 2011 Protocol. Following intense diplomatic efforts by the Bangladesh government, the Indian Parliament unanimously ratified the LBA in 2015. At midnight on July 31, 2015, 111 Indian enclaves became part of Bangladesh and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves became part of India. This peaceful resolution granted citizenship and basic human rights to the enclave dwellers and stands as a globally acclaimed model of peaceful conflict resolution.

**(c) Women's Empowerment**
Women's empowerment refers to the process of enabling women to have control over their own lives and to participate fully in social, economic, and political decision-making. It involves increasing their access to education, healthcare, employment, and political office, as well as challenging the patriarchal norms that create gender inequality. In Bangladesh, women's empowerment has been a key driver of development. It is evident in the high participation of women in the RMG sector, gender parity in school enrollment, and the long tenure of female political leadership. Empowering women leads to better development outcomes, including lower fertility rates, improved child health, and higher household incomes.

**(d) Good Governance**
Good governance refers to the process by which public institutions conduct public affairs and manage public resources in a manner that is transparent, accountable, participatory, efficient, and responsive to the needs of the people, while adhering to the rule of law. The key characteristics of good governance include: participation, rule of law, transparency, responsiveness, consensus-orientation, equity and inclusiveness, effectiveness and efficiency, and accountability. It is considered essential for sustainable development, as it fosters investor confidence, reduces corruption, ensures that public services reach the intended beneficiaries, and protects the rights of citizens.

**(e) Blue Economy**
The Blue Economy refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs, while preserving the health of the ocean ecosystem. For Bangladesh, which gained a vast maritime area in the Bay of Bengal, the Blue Economy represents a new frontier for development. Key sectors of the Blue Economy in Bangladesh include: sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, marine tourism, maritime transport and shipping, exploration and exploitation of offshore oil, gas, and other mineral resources, and harnessing renewable energy from the sea (e.g., offshore wind). The government has identified the Blue Economy as a priority area for future growth.

**(f) Green Economy**
A Green Economy is an economic system that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment. According to UNEP, it is an economy that results in "improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities." Key principles of a Green Economy include promoting the use of renewable energy (solar, wind), improving energy efficiency, reducing waste and pollution, investing in sustainable public transport, practicing sustainable agriculture, and conserving biodiversity. For a climate-vulnerable country like Bangladesh, transitioning to a Green Economy is crucial for ensuring long-term sustainable and resilient development.
