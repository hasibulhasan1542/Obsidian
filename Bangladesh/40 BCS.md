### **Question 01**

#### **(a) Describe the geographical location and physiography of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**

**Geographical Location:**
Bangladesh is located in South Asia, situated between **20°34' and 26°38' North latitude** and between **88°01' and 92°41' East longitude**. It shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, and with Myanmar to the southeast. To its south lies the Bay of Bengal. The Tropic of Cancer passes through the center of the country, giving it a tropical monsoon climate. Its location at the head of the Bay of Bengal makes it a strategic bridge between South and Southeast Asia.

**Physiography:**
The physiography (landform features) of Bangladesh can be divided into three main categories:

**1. Tertiary Hills (Approx. 12% of land area):**
These hills are located in the southeastern and northeastern parts of the country and were formed during the Tertiary geologic period.
*   **The Southeastern Hills:** Found in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (Rangamati, Bandarban, Khagrachhari) and Cox's Bazar, with an average elevation of 610 meters. This region includes Bangladesh's highest peak, **Tazing Dong (Bijoy)**.
*   **The Northeastern Hills:** Low hills or 'tilas' located in the Sylhet division, with an average elevation not exceeding 244 meters.

**2. Pleistocene Terraces (Approx. 8% of land area):**
These are elevated tracts of older alluvium from the Pleistocene epoch.
*   **The Barind Tract:** Located in the northwest (Rajshahi & Rangpur divisions), covering about 9,320 sq. km.
*   **The Madhupur and Bhawal Garh:** Located in the central region (Tangail, Gazipur), with an area of about 4,103 sq. km.

**3. Recent Floodplains (Approx. 80% of land area):**
This is the vast, flat, and fertile plain that dominates the country's landscape, formed by the silt deposited by the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river system. It is the world's largest river delta and is the agricultural heartland of Bangladesh.

#### **(b) Discuss the strategic location of Bangladesh in geopolitics and its risks.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**

Bangladesh's strategic location is a double-edged sword, offering significant geopolitical advantages while also exposing it to considerable risks.

**Strategic Importance:**
1.  **Bridge between South and Southeast Asia:** Bangladesh serves as a physical and cultural land bridge connecting these two vital regions, making it a key node for regional trade, transport, and connectivity initiatives.
2.  **Apex of the Bay of Bengal:** Its position at the head of the Bay of Bengal gives it a commanding presence over a crucial maritime space. The Bay is a major sea lane of communication (SLOC) connecting the Indian Ocean to the Strait of Malacca. This makes Bangladesh a key player in the **Indo-Pacific** strategic construct.
3.  **Proximity to Major Powers:** It is strategically located between two regional giants, **India and China**. This allows Bangladesh to leverage its relationships with both powers for economic and diplomatic gain, pursuing a careful balancing act.
4.  **Gateway for Landlocked Neighbors:** Bangladesh's seaports (Chittagong, Mongla, Payra) offer the most viable sea access for its landlocked neighbors—**Nepal and Bhutan**—and for the landlocked northeastern states of India.

**Risks and Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Caught in Great Power Rivalry:** Its primary risk is being caught in the escalating strategic competition between India and China, and between China and the United States (and its allies in the Quad). Maintaining neutrality and balancing relationships without alienating any major power is a constant diplomatic challenge.
2.  **Transnational Security Threats:** Its porous borders make it vulnerable to transnational security threats, including illegal arms trafficking, drug smuggling (especially yaba from Myanmar), and human trafficking.
3.  **Rohingya Refugee Crisis:** The presence of over one million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar poses a significant security, economic, and environmental risk. The refugee camps are a potential breeding ground for instability and crime, and the crisis puts a strain on relations with Myanmar.
4.  **Climate Change Vulnerability:** As one of the world's most climate-vulnerable nations, its security is threatened by sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and the potential for millions of "climate refugees," which could lead to massive internal and cross-border instability.

### **Question 03**

#### **Mention the different phases of the struggle for independence of Bangladesh from 1947 to 1971.** (Marks: 20)
*(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)*

**Answer:**
The struggle for the independence of Bangladesh was a continuous, escalating process of political, cultural, and economic resistance against the domination of West Pakistan, spanning 24 years.

**Phase 1: The Assertion of Cultural Identity (1947-1952)**
*   **The Language Movement:** The struggle began almost immediately after the partition of 1947, with the demand to make Bengali a state language. This culminated in the martyrdom of students on **February 21, 1952**, establishing cultural nationalism as the foundation of Bengali identity.

**Phase 2: The Demand for Political Autonomy (1953-1965)**
*   **United Front's Victory (1954):** The victory of the Jukto Front on a 21-point platform demanding provincial autonomy, and its subsequent dismissal by the central government, solidified the sense of political deprivation.
*   **Military Rule (1958-1962):** The imposition of martial law by Ayub Khan and the suppression of democracy further alienated East Pakistan.

**Phase 3: The Crystallization of the Nationalist Movement (1966-1969)**
*   **The Six-Point Movement (1966):** Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's **Six-Point Programme** was the "Magna Carta" for Bengalis, providing a clear blueprint for self-rule and effectively calling for a confederation.
*   **The Agartala Conspiracy Case (1968):** This attempt to frame Bangabandhu as a traitor backfired, turning him into the undisputed national leader.
*   **The Mass Uprising of 1969:** A massive popular uprising forced the fall of the Ayub Khan regime and the release of Bangabandhu, demonstrating the power of the people.

**Phase 4: The Path to Independence (1970-1971)**
*   **The 1970 General Election:** The Awami League, led by Bangabandhu, won an absolute majority in Pakistan's first-ever general election, securing a democratic mandate to govern.
*   **The Refusal to Transfer Power:** The Pakistani military junta's refusal to honor the election results led to a political crisis.
*   **The Non-Cooperation Movement (March 1971):** Bangabandhu launched a non-cooperation movement, effectively taking control of East Pakistan. His **7th March Speech** served as the de facto declaration of independence.
*   **Genocide and the Liberation War:** The Pakistani army's genocidal crackdown on **March 25, 1971**, triggered the nine-month-long Liberation War, which led to the birth of an independent Bangladesh.

### **Question 05**

#### **(b) What is the difference between the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) and the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA)?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
While both BEZA and BEPZA are government authorities established to attract investment and promote industrialization, they operate under different legal frameworks and have distinct scopes.

| Basis of Difference | **BEPZA** (Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority) | **BEZA** (Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | **Exclusively export-oriented.** Industries within an EPZ must export at least 80% of their products. | **Both export and domestic market-oriented.** Industries in an EZ can cater to both the domestic and international markets. |
| **Establishment** | Established earlier, under the **Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority Act, 1980**. | Established more recently, under the **Bangladesh Economic Zones Act, 2010**, to provide a more comprehensive framework. |
| **Ownership Model** | The EPZs are **government-owned and operated**. BEPZA acts as the sole developer and manager of the zones. | EZs can be developed through multiple models: **government-owned, privately-owned, or through Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)**. This allows for greater flexibility. |
| **Scope and Scale**| Traditionally focused on a few key sectors, primarily **Ready-Made Garments (RMG)** and textiles. The zones are geographically specific. | Aims to promote a wider range of industries, including heavy industry, manufacturing, and services. It has a broader national scope, with plans for **100 EZs** across the country. |
| **Objective** | To boost exports and earn foreign currency. | To accelerate planned industrialization, create employment, and ensure balanced regional development by establishing economic hubs throughout the country. |

In essence, **BEPZA** created insulated, export-focused enclaves, while **BEZA** represents a more modern, flexible, and comprehensive strategy for nationwide, integrated industrial development.

### **Question 07**

#### **(a) What is meant by war crime?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
A **war crime** is a serious violation of the laws of war (also known as International Humanitarian Law - IHL) that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility. These laws govern the conduct of armed conflict and seek to limit its brutality by protecting those who are not, or are no longer, participating in hostilities and by restricting the means and methods of warfare.

The legal definition of war crimes is codified in international treaties, most notably the **Geneva Conventions of 1949** and their Additional Protocols, and the **Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC)**.

War crimes can be broadly categorized into:
1.  **Grave Breaches of the Geneva Conventions:** These are serious violations committed against persons or property protected by the conventions. Examples include:
    *   Willful killing, torture, or inhuman treatment of prisoners of war or civilians.
    *   Taking of hostages.
    *   Extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity.
2.  **Other Serious Violations of the Laws and Customs of War:** These include a wide range of prohibited acts, such as:
    *   Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population.
    *   Attacking protected objects like hospitals, schools, and religious buildings.
    *   The use of prohibited weapons (e.g., chemical weapons).
    *   Committing rape, sexual slavery, or other forms of sexual violence.
    *   Conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 into armed forces.

Unlike crimes against humanity or genocide, a war crime must have a clear link to an **armed conflict**, either international or internal.

### **Question 08**

#### **(a) What is leadership?** (Marks: 5)

**Answer:**
**Leadership** is the social process of influencing the behavior of other people to voluntarily work towards the achievement of a common goal or a shared vision. It is the ability to inspire, motivate, and guide a group or organization. Leadership is not merely about holding a position of authority (management); rather, it is about earning the trust and respect of followers and empowering them to contribute to a collective objective.

Key components of effective leadership include:
1.  **Vision:** The ability to articulate a clear, compelling, and forward-looking vision for the future that inspires others.
2.  **Influence:** The capacity to persuade and motivate people to act, without relying solely on formal authority.
3.  **Communication:** The skill of effectively conveying ideas, listening to others, and fostering open dialogue.
4.  **Decision-Making:** The ability to make timely and sound judgments, often under pressure.
5.  **Integrity and Trust:** Demonstrating honesty, ethics, and consistency, which builds trust and credibility among followers.

Leadership can be exercised in various styles, such as autocratic, democratic, laissez-faire, and transformational. It is a dynamic process that is crucial for the success of any organization, community, or nation.

#### **(b) Discuss the 'charismatic' leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.** (Marks: 15)
*(This question is a duplicate from the previous paper. The answer is provided again for completeness and context.)*

**Answer:**
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's leadership was quintessentially **charismatic**. Charismatic leadership, as defined by sociologist Max Weber, is a form of authority based on the exceptional personal qualities, heroism, or sanctity of a leader, which inspires devotion and obedience from followers. Bangabandhu embodied this, evolving from a political leader into the undisputed and deeply beloved symbol of the Bengali nation's aspirations.

Key aspects of his charismatic leadership were:

1.  **Unparalleled Oratorical Skill:** Bangabandhu was a master orator. His voice, tone, and powerful use of language could mesmerize and galvanize millions. His **7th March speech** is a prime example, where in 19 minutes he united a nation and laid down the path to independence with unparalleled rhetorical force.

2.  **Unwavering Courage and Sacrifice:** His personal courage in the face of immense repression was legendary. He spent nearly 13 years of his political life in prison (a total of 4,682 days). His willingness to sacrifice his personal freedom and face the threat of death for the cause of his people (as in the Agartala Conspiracy Case and his imprisonment in 1971) created an almost mythical aura around him. He was seen as a leader who would never betray his people.

3.  **Deep Connection with the People:** Bangabandhu possessed an extraordinary ability to connect with the common people. He spoke their language, understood their suffering, and articulated their deepest desires for justice and dignity. This deep empathy earned him the title **"Bangabandhu"** (Friend of Bengal), a title given not by a party, but by the people themselves after the 1969 Mass Uprising.

4.  **Visionary and Uncompromising Idealism:** He presented a clear and powerful vision for his people—a sovereign, secular, and socialist Bangladesh free from exploitation. His steadfast and uncompromising commitment to the **Six-Point Programme**, the blueprint for Bengali autonomy, demonstrated his visionary leadership and his refusal to be swayed from his core principles.

5.  **Symbol of National Unity:** In the fractured political landscape of the time, Bangabandhu emerged as the single, unifying figure around whom the entire Bengali nation could rally. His charisma transcended political and social divisions, making him the embodiment of the struggle for Bangladesh.

It was this unique combination of courage, sacrifice, empathy, and visionary oratory that made Bangabandhu's leadership charismatic, transforming him from a politician into the **Father of the Nation**.

### **Question 09**

#### **(a) Discuss the role of the agriculture sector in the economic development of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
The agriculture sector has historically been the cornerstone of Bangladesh's economy and continues to play a vital, albeit evolving, role in its economic development. While its share in the national GDP has declined with the rise of the industrial and service sectors, its importance remains immense.

**1. Ensuring Food Security and Self-Sufficiency:**
The most critical role of agriculture is ensuring national food security. Through the adoption of high-yield variety (HYV) seeds, modern irrigation, and mechanization, Bangladesh has achieved near self-sufficiency in **rice production**, its staple food. It has also made remarkable progress in producing fish, vegetables, and poultry. This self-sufficiency reduces dependence on food imports, saves valuable foreign currency, and insulates the country from global food price volatility.

**2. Contribution to GDP and Economic Growth:**
Although its share has decreased, the agriculture sector still contributes significantly to the national GDP. As of FY 2022-23, the broad agriculture sector (including crops, livestock, fisheries, and forestry) accounted for approximately **11.38%** of the country's GDP. The steady growth in this sector provides a stable foundation for the overall economy.

**3. Employment Generation and Poverty Reduction:**
Agriculture remains the largest employer in Bangladesh. It provides employment to approximately **45.3%** of the country's total labor force. For the rural population, it is the primary source of livelihood. The growth in agricultural productivity and rural incomes has been one of the single most important drivers of poverty reduction in Bangladesh over the last three decades.

**4. Supplying Raw Materials to Industries:**
The agriculture sector provides essential raw materials for many of the country's major industries. The **jute industry**, the **sugar industry**, the **tea industry**, and the rapidly growing **food processing industry** are all directly dependent on agricultural output.

**5. Role in Macroeconomic Stability:**
A productive agricultural sector helps to keep food prices stable, which is crucial for controlling overall inflation. By earning foreign currency through the export of agricultural products like frozen fish, shrimp, vegetables, and tea, it also contributes to the country's balance of payments.

In conclusion, the agriculture sector is not just a source of food but a vital engine of rural employment, poverty reduction, and industrial supply, making its sustained development essential for the overall economic health and stability of Bangladesh.

#### **(b) Describe the measures taken by the Government of Bangladesh to develop agriculture and improve the living standards of farmers and its successes.** (Marks: 10)

**Answer:**
The Government of Bangladesh has implemented a wide range of sustained and multifaceted measures to develop the agriculture sector and improve the livelihoods of farmers. These policies have been instrumental in transforming the country from a food-deficit nation to one that is self-sufficient in its staple food.

**Measures Taken by the Government:**

1.  **Input Support and Subsidy:**
    *   The government provides massive subsidies on key agricultural inputs to keep production costs low for farmers. This includes subsidies on **fertilizers, seeds, and electricity** for irrigation pumps.
    *   It facilitates the distribution of high-yield variety (HYV) and stress-tolerant (e.g., saline and drought-resistant) seeds developed by institutions like the **Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI)** and the **Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI)**.

2.  **Agricultural Credit and Financial Inclusion:**
    *   The government provides low-interest agricultural loans to farmers through state-owned banks and specialized institutions like the **Bangladesh Krishi Bank**.
    *   It has also introduced a **10 Taka bank account** scheme for farmers to promote financial inclusion and facilitate the direct transfer of subsidies.

3.  **Research and Development (R&D):**
    *   The government actively supports agricultural research institutions like BRRI and BARI. This has led to the development of hundreds of new crop varieties with higher yields and greater resistance to pests and climate change. For example, BRRI has developed over 100 modern rice varieties.

4.  **Mechanization of Agriculture:**
    *   To address labor shortages and increase efficiency, the government is promoting farm mechanization by providing subsidies of up to **50-70%** on the purchase of agricultural machinery like tractors, power tillers, and combine harvesters.

5.  **Marketing and Price Support:**
    *   The government's domestic procurement program for rice and paddy provides a minimum support price to farmers, protecting them from price volatility after the harvest.
    *   It is also working to improve agricultural marketing systems by developing storage facilities and improving rural infrastructure.

**Successes of These Measures:**
*   **Food Self-Sufficiency:** The most significant success is achieving self-sufficiency in rice production. Rice production has increased from around 11 million metric tons in 1971 to over **38 million metric tons** in recent years.
*   **Crop Diversification:** There has been remarkable success in the production of other crops. Bangladesh is now one of the world's top producers of **vegetables, potatoes, and freshwater fish**.
*   **Poverty Reduction:** The growth in agricultural productivity has been a primary driver of the dramatic reduction in rural poverty in Bangladesh.
*   **Increased Resilience:** The development and dissemination of stress-tolerant crop varieties have enhanced the resilience of the agricultural system to the impacts of climate change.
