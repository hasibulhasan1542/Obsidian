*Innovation Distinguishes Between a Leader and a Follower. 
— Steve Jobs 

Leadership is often perceived as a position of power, control, and decision-making. However, true leadership is deeply rooted in discipline, experience, and an understanding of obedience. The ability to command effectively does not come from authority alone but from the wisdom gained through submission, learning, and experience. In this essay we will highlight the fact: before one can lead, one must first learn to follow.

Many highly successful CEOs began their careers at the very bottom of the corporate ladder, often taking on entry-level roles with minimal responsibilities. Over time, they gained invaluable experience by carefully observing their superiors, diligently following company protocols, and thoroughly understanding the intricate dynamics of their respective industries. Through years of dedication, hard work, and perseverance, they developed a deep knowledge of their field, honed essential skills, and built strong professional networks. Their willingness to obey rules, adapt to changing circumstances, and continuously learn from both successes and failures played a crucial role in shaping them into effective and influential leaders. These qualities not only helped them rise through the ranks but also enabled them to make informed decisions, inspire their teams, and drive their organizations toward long-term success.

Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors, is an excellent example of a leader who first learned to follow before taking command. She started her career at GM at the age of 18 as a co-op student, inspecting fender panels and hoods. Her early experiences on the factory floor allowed her to gain a deep understanding of the company’s technical and operational challenges. Rising through various engineering and administrative roles, she demonstrated an unwavering commitment to learning and growth. Barra’s rise to leadership was not sudden but the result of decades of dedication, discipline, and a willingness to absorb knowledge at every level of the company.

Obedience is often misunderstood as blind submission, but in reality, it is a structured discipline that fosters growth. It involves following rules, respecting authority, and learning from those who have more experience. It is through obedience that individuals gain the necessary skills, knowledge, and understanding required for leadership.

Leadership is not merely about giving orders; it is about making informed decisions, guiding others, and inspiring people to work towards a common goal. A good leader understands the challenges faced by their subordinates because they have once been in their position. This understanding comes from having obeyed and learned under the guidance of a superior.

Angela Merkel, before becoming Germany’s Chancellor, worked as a research scientist in East Germany and later as a deputy spokesperson in the first democratically elected East German government. Her early career required her to follow strict institutional hierarchies and protocols, instilling in her a sense of discipline and an appreciation for structured governance. Her ability to listen, learn, and adapt under different political regimes equipped her with the diplomatic and strategic skills that later defined her leadership on the world stage.

The transition from a follower to a leader is a process that requires patience, discipline, and learning. Many successful leaders started as subordinates, learning the intricacies of their field before rising to command.

Dwight D. Eisenhower, before becoming the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in World War II and later the President of the United States, served under various senior military leaders. His early career was marked by a diligent study of military strategy and strict adherence to command hierarchies. These experiences equipped him with the strategic acumen and calm decisiveness that would later make him one of history’s most respected military and political leaders.

Obedience instills discipline, which is a crucial trait in leadership. Leaders who have once followed orders understand the importance of discipline and adherence to rules. Without this, leadership can become chaotic and ineffective.

In sports, Michael Jordan’s leadership on the basketball court is legendary. Before becoming a commanding figure in the Chicago Bulls’ dynasty, Jordan had to learn the value of teamwork and the importance of following coaching strategies under Phil Jackson. His ability to merge individual brilliance with team cohesion, developed through years of disciplined practice and respect for his coaches, became the hallmark of his leadership, resulting in six NBA championships.

Those who have obeyed before leading have a reservoir of experiences from which they can draw lessons. They understand what works and what doesn’t, allowing them to make informed decisions.

A leader who has never learned the value of obedience may find it difficult to relate to their subordinates and understand their concerns. However, a leader who has once been in their position, experiencing the same struggles and challenges, is far better equipped to empathize with their team. Such a leader can provide meaningful guidance, motivation, and support, fostering an environment of mutual respect and trust.

One of the greatest historical examples of this principle is Alexander the Great. Before becoming one of history’s most renowned military commanders, he was first a student of the great philosopher Aristotle. He was also a disciplined and obedient subordinate to his father, King Philip II of Macedon, who was a formidable leader and military strategist in his own right. Under his father’s command, Alexander gained invaluable firsthand experience in military strategy, leadership, and governance. His willingness to obey and absorb wisdom from his superiors played a crucial role in shaping him into the remarkable leader he became. By learning from the best, he developed the skills and strategic mindset necessary to lead one of the most powerful armies the world had ever seen, conquering vast territories and leaving a lasting legacy in history.

Successful political leaders often begin their careers in entry-level positions, learning from seniors and mentors, gaining a deep understanding of governance, and adhering to established protocols. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, for instance, worked as a law professor and Attorney General of Arkansas before becoming governor and eventually President. His gradual rise through different levels of responsibility allowed him to develop a deep understanding of political processes and public service, which shaped his approach to leadership.

Individuals who assume leadership without first learning to follow often face challenges in decision-making, struggle to empathize with their subordinates, and fail to earn respect. Such leaders risk becoming authoritarian, disconnected, and indifferent to the realities their followers experience.

True leadership is a journey of continuous growth, shaped by discipline, experience, and the ability to learn from others. Leaders who have once been followers develop a strong foundation of knowledge, empathy, and strategic thinking. They understand the value of patience, humility, and adaptability, qualities that enable them to inspire and guide others effectively. The ability to obey is not a sign of weakness but a stepping stone to wisdom, allowing future leaders to navigate challenges with insight and confidence. The most effective leaders are those who have first embraced the journey of learning before stepping into positions of authority.
