### **1. (a) Find the range of values for p for which the equation x² - 2px + p² + 5p - 6 = 0 has no real roots.**

**Solution:**
For a quadratic equation `ax² + bx + c = 0` to have no real roots, its discriminant `D` must be less than zero. `D = b² - 4ac < 0`.
Here, `a=1`, `b=-2p`, `c = p² + 5p - 6`.
$$ D = (-2p)^2 - 4(1)(p^2 + 5p - 6) < 0 $$
$$ 4p^2 - 4(p^2 + 5p - 6) < 0 $$
$$ 4p^2 - 4p^2 - 20p + 24 < 0 $$
$$ -20p + 24 < 0 $$
$$ 24 < 20p $$
$$ p > \frac{24}{20} \implies p > \frac{6}{5} $$
**Answer:** $$ p > \frac{6}{5} $$

### **1. (b) If x² + 1/x² = 7, find the value of (x⁶+1)/x³.**

**Solution:**
The expression to find is `x⁶/x³ + 1/x³ = x³ + 1/x³`.
First, find `x + 1/x`.
$$ \left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = (x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}) + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9 $$
$$ x + \frac{1}{x} = \pm\sqrt{9} = \pm 3 $$
Now, use the identity `a³+b³ = (a+b)³ - 3ab(a+b)`:
$$ x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = \left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)^3 - 3\left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right) $$
Case 1: `x + 1/x = 3`
$$ x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = (3)^3 - 3(3) = 27 - 9 = 18 $$
Case 2: `x + 1/x = -3`
$$ x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = (-3)^3 - 3(-3) = -27 + 9 = -18 $$
**Answer:** $$ \pm 18 $$

### **2. (a) Given p = xʸᵃ⁻¹, q = xʸᵇ⁻¹, r = xʸᶜ⁻¹, what is (p)ᵇ⁻ᶜ (q)ᶜ⁻ᵃ (r)ᵃ⁻ᵇ?**
*(Note: There is a typo in the OCR. The question is likely `pᵇ⁻ᶜ qᶜ⁻ᵃ rᵃ⁻ᵇ`)*

**Solution:**
Substitute the expressions for p, q, and r:
$$ (xy^{a-1})^{b-c} \cdot (xy^{b-1})^{c-a} \cdot (xy^{c-1})^{a-b} $$
Distribute the exponents:
$$ (x^{b-c} y^{(a-1)(b-c)}) \cdot (x^{c-a} y^{(b-1)(c-a)}) \cdot (x^{a-b} y^{(c-1)(a-b)}) $$
Group the x and y terms by adding their exponents:
Exponent of x: `(b-c) + (c-a) + (a-b) = 0`. So `x⁰=1`.
Exponent of y: `(ab-ac-b+c) + (bc-ba-c+a) + (ca-cb-a+b) = 0`. So `y⁰=1`.
The expression equals `x⁰ \cdot y⁰ = 1`.
**Answer:** $$ 1 $$

**(b) Prove that log(pᵇ⁻ᶜ) + log(qᶜ⁻ᵃ) + log(rᵃ⁻ᵇ) = 0.**
*(Assuming the same p,q,r as above. This is another standard variant)*
**Solution:**
LHS = `\log(p^{b-c} q^{c-a} r^{a-b}) = \log(1) = 0` (from part a).
**Hence, proved.**

### **3. (a) The sum of the monthly salaries of two workers is Tk 20,000. If one worker's salary decreases by 10%, the amount is equal to the other worker's salary increased by 10%. Find the monthly salary of each worker.**

**Solution:**
Let the salaries be `S₁` and `S₂`.
`S₁ + S₂ = 20000` --- (1)
`S₁(1 - 10\%) = S₂(1 + 10\%)`
`0.9 S₁ = 1.1 S₂ \implies S₁ = (11/9) S₂`
Substitute into (1):
` (11/9) S₂ + S₂ = 20000 `
` (20/9) S₂ = 20000 \implies S₂ = 9000 `
` S₁ = 20000 - 9000 = 11000 `
**Answer:** The salaries are Tk 11,000 and Tk 9,000.

**(b) By selling 4 chocolates for a taka, there is a 10% loss. How many chocolates must be sold for a taka to make a 20% profit?**

**Solution:**
Let the cost price of 4 chocolates be `C`.
Selling price `S = 1` Taka. Loss = 10%.
`S = C(1 - 10\%) \implies 1 = 0.9 C \implies C = 1/0.9 = 10/9` Taka.
This is the cost of 4 chocolates.
Cost per chocolate = `(10/9) / 4 = 10/36 = 5/18` Taka.
To make a 20% profit, the new selling price per chocolate `S'` must be:
`S' = (Cost per chocolate) \times (1 + 20\%) = (5/18) \times 1.2 = (5/18) \times (12/10) = 60/180 = 1/3` Taka.
So, each chocolate must be sold for 1/3 Taka.
Number of chocolates sold for 1 Taka = `1 / S' = 1 / (1/3) = 3`.
**Answer:** 3 chocolates.

### **4. 'A' can do a piece of work in 14 days and 'B' in 28 days. They start working together, but after a few days, 'A' leaves, and 'B' finishes the remaining work in 7 days. For how many days did they work together?**

**Solution:**
Rate of A: `R_A = 1/14` work/day.
Rate of B: `R_B = 1/28` work/day.
Combined Rate: `R_{A+B} = 1/14 + 1/28 = (2+1)/28 = 3/28` work/day.
Work done by B alone in the last 7 days:
`W_B = R_B \times 7 = (1/28) \times 7 = 1/4` of the work.
Work done by A and B together: `W_{A+B} = 1 - W_B = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4`.
Time they worked together `t`:
`t = W_{A+B} / R_{A+B} = (3/4) / (3/28) = (3/4) \times (28/3) = 7` days.
**Answer:** They worked together for 7 days. The total time was `7+7 = 14` days.

### **5. In a survey of students, 60% read Bichitra, 50% read Sandhani, 50% read Purbani. 30% read B&S, 30% read B&P, 20% read S&P, and 10% read all three. Find the percentage of students who read exactly two magazines.**

**Solution:**
Let B, S, P be the sets of readers.
`n(B)=60, n(S)=50, n(P)=50`.
`n(B∩S)=30, n(B∩P)=30, n(S∩P)=20`.
`n(B∩S∩P)=10`.
Percentage reading exactly two = `n(B∩S only) + n(S∩P only) + n(B∩P only)`.
`n(B∩S only) = n(B∩S) - n(B∩S∩P) = 30 - 10 = 20`.
`n(S∩P only) = n(S∩P) - n(B∩S∩P) = 20 - 10 = 10`.
`n(B∩P only) = n(B∩P) - n(B∩S∩P) = 30 - 10 = 20`.
Total = `20 + 10 + 20 = 50`.
**Answer:** 50% of students read exactly two magazines.

### **6. Gani Shaheb's basic salary in July 2016 was Tk 22,000. His annual increment is Tk 1000.**
**(a) Form an arithmetic series and find his monthly basic salary in July 2025.**
**(b) If 10% of his basic salary is deducted monthly for a provident fund, what will be his total deposit in 20 years?**

**Solution:**
**(a)** The series for the salary in July of each year is an AP.
First term (July 2016) `a = 22000`. Common difference `d = 1000`.
July 2025 is 9 years after July 2016. So we need the 10th term (`n=10`).
Salary in July 2025 = `a + (10-1)d = 22000 + 9(1000) = 31000`.
**Answer (a):** The monthly salary will be Tk 31,000.

**(b)** Total time = 20 years = `20 \times 12 = 240` months.
The salary remains constant for 12 months each year.
1st year (12 months): Salary = 22000, Deposit/month = 2200. Total = `2200 \times 12`.
2nd year (12 months): Salary = 23000, Deposit/month = 2300. Total = `2300 \times 12`.
...
20th year (12 months): Salary = `22000 + 19(1000) = 41000`, Deposit/month=4100. Total = `4100 \times 12`.
Total Deposit = `12 \times (2200 + 2300 + ... + 4100)`.
This is an AP with `a=2200, d=100, n=20`.
Sum = `(n/2)(2a + (n-1)d) = (20/2)(2(2200) + 19(100)) = 10(4400 + 1900) = 10(6300) = 63000`.
Total Deposit = `12 \times 63000 = 756000`.
**Answer (b):** His total deposit will be Tk 756,000.

### **7. A line with slope 3 passes through A(-1, 6) and intersects the x-axis at B. Another line passing through A intersects the x-axis at C(2, 0).**
**(a) Find the equations of lines AB and AC.**
**(b) Find the area of △ABC.**

**Solution:**
**(a) Equations of Lines:**
Line AB: Slope `m=3`, point `A(-1,6)`. Using `y-y₁=m(x-x₁)`.
`y - 6 = 3(x - (-1)) \implies y-6 = 3x+3 \implies 3x - y + 9 = 0`.
Line AC: Passes through `A(-1,6)` and `C(2,0)`.
Slope `m = (0-6)/(2-(-1)) = -6/3 = -2`.
`y - 0 = -2(x - 2) \implies y = -2x+4 \implies 2x + y - 4 = 0`.
**Answer (a):** AB: `3x-y+9=0`, AC: `2x+y-4=0`.

**(b) Area of △ABC:**
We need point B. It's the x-intercept of line AB, so `y=0`.
`3x - 0 + 9 = 0 \implies 3x = -9 \implies x = -3`. So `B(-3,0)`.
Vertices are `A(-1,6), B(-3,0), C(2,0)`.
Base BC is on the x-axis. Length of base = `|2 - (-3)| = 5`.
Height of the triangle is the y-coordinate of A, which is 6.
Area = `(1/2) \times base \times height = (1/2) \times 5 \times 6 = 15`.
**Answer (b):** The area is 15 square units.

### **8. From an external point P, two tangents PA and PB are drawn to a circle with center O.**
**(a) Prove PA = PB.**
**(b) Prove that the line segment OP is the perpendicular bisector of the tangent chord AB.**

**Solution:**
**(a)** In `△OAP` and `△OBP`:
1. `OA = OB` (Radii of the same circle)
2. `OP = OP` (Common side)
3. `∠OAP = ∠OBP = 90°` (Radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact)
By RHS congruence, `△OAP ≅ △OBP`.
Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding parts are equal.
`PA = PB`. **Hence, proved.**

**(b)** From the congruence in part (a), `∠AOP = ∠BOP` (by CPCTC).
Now, consider `△OAM` and `△OBM`, where M is the intersection of OP and AB.
1. `OA = OB` (Radii)
2. `∠AOM = ∠BOM` (Proved above, same angles as `∠AOP, ∠BOP`)
3. `OM = OM` (Common side)
By SAS congruence, `△OAM ≅ △OBM`.
By CPCTC:
`AM = BM`, which means OP bisects the chord AB.
`∠OMA = ∠OMB`. Since these form a linear pair, `∠OMA + ∠OMB = 180° \implies 2∠OMA = 180° \implies ∠OMA = 90°`.
This means OP is perpendicular to AB.
Thus, OP is the perpendicular bisector of AB. **Hence, proved.**

### **9. The angle bisector AP of ∠A of △ABC intersects BC at point P. Prove that BP : PC = BA : AC.**

**Solution:**
This is the **Angle Bisector Theorem**.
**Proof:** Draw a line `CE` parallel to `AP`, such that it meets the extension of side `BA` at `E`.
Since `CE || AP`, by corresponding angles, `∠BAP = ∠AEC`.
By alternate interior angles, `∠PAC = ∠ACE`.
Given that AP is the angle bisector, `∠BAP = ∠PAC`.
Therefore, `∠AEC = ∠ACE`.
In `△ACE`, since two angles are equal, the sides opposite them are also equal: `AC = AE`.

Now, consider the large triangle `△BCE`. The line `AP` is parallel to the side `CE`.
By the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales's Theorem):
$$ \frac{BP}{PC} = \frac{BA}{AE} $$
Since we proved `AE = AC`, we can substitute it into the equation:
$$ \frac{BP}{PC} = \frac{BA}{AC} $$
This can be written as `BP : PC = BA : AC`. **Hence, proved.**

### **10. The probability of an engineer getting a plumbing contract is 2/3, and the probability of not getting an electric contract is 5/9. If the probability of getting at least one contract is 4/5, what is the probability of getting both contracts?**

**Solution:**
Let `P(Plumb) = 2/3`.
`P(Elec') = 5/9 \implies P(Elec) = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9`.
`P(Plumb ∪ Elec) = 4/5`.
We know `P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)`.
`P(Plumb ∪ Elec) = P(Plumb) + P(Elec) - P(Plumb ∩ Elec)`
$$ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{9} - P(\text{Both}) $$
$$ P(\text{Both}) = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{9} - \frac{4}{5} $$
The common denominator is 45.
$$ P(\text{Both}) = \frac{2 \times 15}{45} + \frac{4 \times 5}{45} - \frac{4 \times 9}{45} = \frac{30 + 20 - 36}{45} = \frac{14}{45} $$
**Answer:** The probability of getting both contracts is $$ \frac{14}{45} $$.
