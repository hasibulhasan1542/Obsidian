### **1. (a) If 2x² - 3x = 2, find the value of x³ - 1/x³.**

**Solution:**
Given `2x² - 3x = 2`. Since `x=0` is not a solution, we can divide by `x`:
$$ 2x - 3 = \frac{2}{x} \implies 2x - \frac{2}{x} = 3 \implies 2\left(x - \frac{1}{x}\right) = 3 \implies x - \frac{1}{x} = \frac{3}{2} $$
We need to find `x³ - 1/x³`. Using the identity `a³ - b³ = (a-b)³ + 3ab(a-b)`:
$$ x^3 - \frac{1}{x^3} = \left(x - \frac{1}{x}\right)^3 + 3 \cdot x \cdot \frac{1}{x} \left(x - \frac{1}{x}\right) $$
$$ = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^3 + 3(1)\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) $$
$$ = \frac{27}{8} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{27 + 36}{8} = \frac{63}{8} $$
**Answer:** $$ \frac{63}{8} $$

### **1. (b) Factorize: a⁶ + 6a⁴b + 11a²b² + 6b³.**
*(Note: There is a likely typo. For factorization, the last term should be `6b⁶`. Let's assume `a⁶ + 6a⁴b² + 11a²b⁴ + 6b⁶` or similar. As written, it's not a standard homogeneous polynomial.)*
Let's solve the most probable intended problem: **Factorize a³ + 6a²b + 11ab² + 6b³.**
**Solution (for the probable intended cubic form):**
Let `P(a) = a³ + 6a²b + 11ab² + 6b³`.
Try `a = -b`: `P(-b) = (-b)³ + 6(-b)²b + 11(-b)b² + 6b³ = -b³ + 6b³ - 11b³ + 6b³ = 0`.
So, `(a+b)` is a factor.
Try `a = -2b`: `P(-2b) = (-2b)³ + 6(-2b)²b + 11(-2b)b² + 6b³ = -8b³ + 24b³ - 22b³ + 6b³ = 0`.
So, `(a+2b)` is a factor.
Try `a = -3b`: `P(-3b) = (-3b)³ + 6(-3b)²b + 11(-3b)b² + 6b³ = -27b³ + 54b³ - 33b³ + 6b³ = 0`.
So, `(a+3b)` is a factor.
Since the expression is cubic, the factors are `(a+b)`, `(a+2b)`, and `(a+3b)`.
**Answer (for the probable intended cubic):** $$ (a+b)(a+2b)(a+3b) $$

### **2. (a) If aˣ = bʸ, bʸ = cᶻ and cᶻ = a, find the value of xyz.**
*(Note: The second two conditions are redundant with the first. The likely intended problem is `aˣ=b`, `bʸ=c`, `cᶻ=a`.)*

**Solution (for the intended problem `aˣ=b, bʸ=c, cᶻ=a`):**
We have `c = bʸ`. Substitute `b = aˣ`:
$$ c = (a^x)^y = a^{xy} $$
Now use the third equation, `cᶻ = a`:
$$ (a^{xy})^z = a $$
$$ a^{xyz} = a^1 $$
Equating the exponents:
$$ xyz = 1 $$
**Answer:** $$ xyz = 1 $$

---
### **2. (b) What is the value of log₂√₅(400)?**

**Solution:**
Let $$`x = \log_{2\sqrt{5}}(400)`.$$
By the definition of logarithm, $$`(2\sqrt{5})^x = 400`.$$
We can write $$`400 = 20^2`.$$
We can write $$`20 = 2^2 \times 5 = 4 \times 5`.$$
$$`400 = (4 \times 5)^2`.$$
Let's express the base `2\sqrt{5}` in terms of its square: $$`(2\sqrt{5})^2 = 4 \times 5 = 20`.$$
So, $$`400 = 20^2 = ((2\sqrt{5})^2)^2 = (2\sqrt{5})^4`.$$
The equation becomes:
$$ (2\sqrt{5})^x = (2\sqrt{5})^4 $$
Equating the exponents:
$$ x = 4 $$
**Answer:** $$ 4 $$

### **3. The slope of the line passing through A(1, 4a) and B(5, a²-1) is 1. Find the value of 'a'. For the values of 'a', four points are obtained; find the area of the quadrilateral PQRS formed by these four points P, Q, R, S. Is PQRS a parallelogram or a rectangle? Explain.**

**Solution:**
Slope `m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁) = 1`.
$$ \frac{(a^2-1) - 4a}{5 - 1} = 1 $$
$$ a^2 - 4a - 1 = 4 \implies a^2 - 4a - 5 = 0 $$
$$ (a-5)(a+1) = 0 \implies a = 5 \text{ or } a = -1 $$
For `a=5`: A=(1, 20), B=(5, 24).
For `a=-1`: A=(1, -4), B=(5, 0).
The four points are P(1, 20), Q(5, 24), R(1, -4), S(5, 0).
Let's find the area of PQSR (assuming this order).
This quadrilateral is a trapezoid since lines PQ and RS are vertical, but PS and QR are not.
This is not a standard quadrilateral. Let's assume the question means the quadrilateral formed by the A-points and B-points: P(1,20), Q(5,24), R(5,0), S(1,-4).
Slope PQ = `(24-20)/(5-1) = 4/4 = 1`.
Slope QR = `(0-24)/(5-5) =` undefined (vertical).
Slope RS = `(-4-0)/(1-5) = -4/-4 = 1`.
Slope SP = `(20-(-4))/(1-1) =` undefined (vertical).
Since PQ || RS and QR || SP, it is a **parallelogram**. Since adjacent sides are not perpendicular (slope 1 is not the negative reciprocal of undefined), it is not a rectangle.
Area of Parallelogram: Base `QR = 24-0=24`. Height = horizontal distance = `5-1=4`.
Area = `base \times height = 24 \times 4 = 96`.
Alternatively, using the Shoelace formula for P(1,20), Q(5,24), R(5,0), S(1,-4):
$$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |(1\cdot24 + 5\cdot0 + 5\cdot(-4) + 1\cdot20) - (20\cdot5 + 24\cdot5 + 0\cdot1 + (-4)\cdot1)| $$
$$ = \frac{1}{2} |(24 + 0 - 20 + 20) - (100 + 120 + 0 - 4)| = \frac{1}{2} |24 - 216| = \frac{1}{2} |-192| = 96 $$
**Answer:** `a = 5, -1`. The area is 96 sq. units. It is a parallelogram but not a rectangle.

### **4. At a location on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of a building is 60°. After moving 42m back from that place, the angle of elevation of that point of the building becomes 45°. Find the height of the building.**

**Solution:**
Let `h` be the height of the building. Let the initial distance from the base be `x`.
$$ \tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{x} \implies \sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{x} \implies x = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \quad \text{--- (1)} $$
The new distance is `x + 42`.
$$ \tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{x+42} \implies 1 = \frac{h}{x+42} \implies h = x+42 \quad \text{--- (2)} $$
Substitute (1) into (2):
$$ h = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} + 42 \implies h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = 42 $$
$$ h\left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = 42 \implies h\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = 42 $$
$$ h = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}-1} = \frac{42\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\sqrt{3}-1)(\sqrt{3}+1)} = \frac{42(3+\sqrt{3})}{3-1} $$
$$ h = \frac{42(3+\sqrt{3})}{2} = 21(3+\sqrt{3}) $$
**Answer:** $$ 21(3+\sqrt{3}) \text{ meters} $$

### **5. The perimeter of a rectangle is 4 meters more than the sum of the lengths of its diagonals. If the area of the field is 48 square meters, find its length and width.**
*(Note: There is a typo, it should be "length of its diagonal", singular. A rectangle has two equal diagonals.)*

**Solution:**
Let length be `L` and width be `W`.
Perimeter `P = 2(L+W)`. Diagonal `d = \sqrt{L^2+W^2}`. Area `A = LW = 48`.
Given: `P = d + 4` (assuming singular diagonal)
`2(L+W) = \sqrt{L^2+W^2} + 4`.
From `(L+W)² = L² + W² + 2LW`, we have `d² = (L+W)² - 2A = (L+W)² - 96`.
So, `d = \sqrt{(L+W)² - 96}`.
Let `S = L+W`. The equation becomes:
`2S = \sqrt{S^2-96} + 4 \implies 2S-4 = \sqrt{S^2-96}`
Square both sides: `(2S-4)² = S²-96`
`4S² - 16S + 16 = S² - 96`
`3S² - 16S + 112 = 0`.
The discriminant of this quadratic is `(-16)² - 4(3)(112) = 256 - 1344 < 0`. There are no real solutions for S.
**Conclusion: The problem statement contains contradictory information.**

### **6. (a) From the given figure, what is the length of AC? What is the value of tanA + tanC? What are the values of x and y?**

**Solution:**
The figure shows a right-angled triangle `ABC`, right-angled at `B`. It's split into two right triangles by an altitude from `B` to `AC`. This is not standard.
Let's assume the outer triangle `ABC` is a single right triangle.
`AB = x+y`, `BC = x-y`, `AC = ?`.
`AB = 1`, `BC = \sqrt{3}`.
This implies it is a `30-60-90` triangle. `∠C = 30°`, `∠A = 60°`.
Using Pythagoras theorem for `△ABC`:
$$ AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2 = 1 + 3 = 4 $$
$$ AC = \sqrt{4} = 2 $$
Values of tanA and tanC:
$$ \tan A = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3} $$
$$ \tan C = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $$
$$ \tan A + \tan C = \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3+1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} $$
The variables `x` and `y` are confusingly placed. If we assume the altitude from `B` to `AC` has length 1, then the diagram is flawed.
Let's assume the labels are for the sides: `AB = x+y = 1` and `BC = x-y = \sqrt{3}`.
This is a system of linear equations.
Add them: `(x+y) + (x-y) = 1 + \sqrt{3} \implies 2x = 1+\sqrt{3} \implies x = (1+\sqrt{3})/2`.
Subtract them: `(x+y) - (x-y) = 1 - \sqrt{3} \implies 2y = 1-\sqrt{3} \implies y = (1-\sqrt{3})/2`.
**Answers:**
*   AC = 2
*   tanA + tanC = 4/√3
*   x = (1+√3)/2, y = (1-√3)/2

### **7. (b) If 0 < θ < 2π, solve: 2(sinθcosθ + √3) = √3cosθ + 4sinθ**

**Solution:**
$$ 2\sin\theta\cos\theta + 2\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3}\cos\theta + 4\sin\theta $$
$$ 2\sin\theta\cos\theta - 4\sin\theta - \sqrt{3}\cos\theta + 2\sqrt{3} = 0 $$
$$ 2\sin\theta(\cos\theta - 2) - \sqrt{3}(\cos\theta - 2) = 0 $$
$$ (2\sin\theta - \sqrt{3})(\cos\theta - 2) = 0 $$
This gives two possibilities:
1. `\cos\theta - 2 = 0 \implies \cos\theta = 2`. This has no solution as `-1 \le \cos\theta \le 1`.
2. `2\sin\theta - \sqrt{3} = 0 \implies \sin\theta = \sqrt{3}/2`.
For `0 < θ < 2π`, `sinθ` is positive in the 1st and 2nd quadrants.
The reference angle is `\arcsin(\sqrt{3}/2) = \pi/3`.
1st Quadrant: `θ = \pi/3`.
2nd Quadrant: `θ = \pi - \pi/3 = 2\pi/3`.
**Answer:** $$ \theta = \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{2\pi}{3} $$

### **8. If $$Y = (\sqrt{(2p+3q)} + \sqrt{(2p-3q))} / (√(2p+3q) - √(2p-3q))$$, prove that 3q(1 + 1/y²) = 4p/y.**
*(Note: There is a likely typo in the question, based on standard Componendo-Dividendo problems. The expression to prove is likely `3qy² - 4py + 3q = 0`)*

**Solution (proving the standard variant):**
Apply Componendo-Dividendo on `Y/1`:
$$ \frac{Y+1}{Y-1} = \frac{(\sqrt{2p+3q} + \sqrt{2p-3q}) + (\sqrt{2p+3q} - \sqrt{2p-3q})}{(\sqrt{2p+3q} + \sqrt{2p-3q}) - (\sqrt{2p+3q} - \sqrt{2p-3q})} $$
$$ \frac{Y+1}{Y-1} = \frac{2\sqrt{2p+3q}}{2\sqrt{2p-3q}} = \frac{\sqrt{2p+3q}}{\sqrt{2p-3q}} $$
Square both sides:
$$ \frac{(Y+1)^2}{(Y-1)^2} = \frac{2p+3q}{2p-3q} $$
$$ \frac{Y^2+2Y+1}{Y^2-2Y+1} = \frac{2p+3q}{2p-3q} $$
Apply Componendo-Dividendo again:
$$ \frac{(Y^2+2Y+1)+(Y^2-2Y+1)}{(Y^2+2Y+1)-(Y^2-2Y+1)} = \frac{(2p+3q)+(2p-3q)}{(2p+3q)-(2p-3q)} $$
$$ \frac{2Y^2+2}{4Y} = \frac{4p}{6q} \implies \frac{Y^2+1}{2Y} = \frac{2p}{3q} $$
$$ 3q(Y^2+1) = 2Y(2p) = 4pY $$
$$ 3qY^2 - 4pY + 3q = 0 $$
This is a standard identity. The question as written cannot be easily proven.

### **10. Solve:**
**(a) 2ˣ + 2¹⁻ˣ = 3**
**Solution:** `2^x + 2/2^x = 3`. Let `y = 2^x`. `y + 2/y = 3 \implies y^2 - 3y + 2 = 0`.
`(y-1)(y-2) = 0 \implies y=1` or `y=2`.
If `2^x = 1 \implies x=0`. If `2^x=2 \implies x=1`. **Answer: x = 0, 1**

**(b) logₓ(1/16) = -2**
**Solution:** `x⁻² = 1/16 = 1/4² = 4⁻²`. So, `x=4`. **Answer: x = 4**

**(c) (√3)ˣ⁺¹ = (∛3)²ˣ⁻¹**
**Solution:** `(3^{1/2})^{x+1} = (3^{1/3})^{2x-1}`
`3^{(x+1)/2} = 3^{(2x-1)/3}`
`(x+1)/2 = (2x-1)/3 \implies 3(x+1) = 2(2x-1) \implies 3x+3 = 4x-2 \implies x=5`.
**Answer: x = 5**

### **11. (a) If A and B are the sets of factors of 36 and 45 respectively, find A∪B and A∩B.**
**Solution:**
Factors of 36: `A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36}`
Factors of 45: `B = {1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45}`
`A \cup B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 36, 45}`
`A \cap B = {1, 3, 9}`
**Answer:** See sets above.

---
### **11. (b) If A = {x | x ∈ ℕ, x³ > 25 and x⁴ < 264}, find P(A).**
*(Note: There is a typo x²<264, likely should be x⁴<264)*
**Solution (assuming x⁴ < 264):**
We need natural numbers `x` such that `x³ > 25` and `x⁴ < 264`.
`x=1: 1³=1, 1⁴=1` (No)
`x=2: 2³=8, 2⁴=16` (No)
`x=3: 3³=27, 3⁴=81` (Yes)
`x=4: 4³=64, 4⁴=256` (Yes)
`x=5: 5³=125, 5⁴=625` (No, 625 is not < 264)
So, the set is `A = {3, 4}`.
The power set `P(A)` is the set of all subsets of A.
**Answer:** $$ P(A) = \{\emptyset, \{3\}, \{4\}, \{3, 4\}\} $$

### **12. Given log(1+x)/logx = 2.**
**(a) Prove that the given equation is a quadratic equation in variable x.**
**(b) Solve the equation and show that only one root satisfies the equation.**

**Solution:**
**(a)** `\log(1+x) = 2 \log x = \log(x^2)`.
This implies `1+x = x^2`.
`x^2 - x - 1 = 0`.
This is a quadratic equation of the form `ax²+bx+c=0`. **Hence, proved.**

**(b)** Using the quadratic formula for `x²-x-1=0`:
`x = (-(-1) ± \sqrt{(-1)² - 4(1)(-1)}) / 2 = (1 ± \sqrt{1+4}) / 2 = (1 ± \sqrt{5}) / 2`.
The roots are `x₁ = (1+√5)/2` (the golden ratio, `φ ≈ 1.618`) and `x₂ = (1-√5)/2 ≈ -0.618`.
For the original logarithmic equation `log(1+x)/logx = 2` to be defined, the arguments of the logarithms must be positive (`1+x > 0` and `x > 0`) and the base must be positive and not 1. Assuming base 10, we only need `x > 0`.
The root `x₁ ≈ 1.618` is positive, so it is a valid solution.
The root `x₂ ≈ -0.618` is negative. `log(x₂)` is undefined in real numbers. So, it is an extraneous root.
**Answer:** Only the root `x = (1+√5)/2` satisfies the original equation.
