### **1. (a) If x + 1/x = 3, find the value of x⁴ + x³ + x² + 1/x² + 1/x³ + 1/x⁴.**

**Solution:**
Rearrange the expression by grouping terms with the same power:
$$ \left(x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4}\right) + \left(x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3}\right) + \left(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}\right) $$
Given `x + 1/x = 3`.

Step 1: Find `x² + 1/x²`
$$ x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)^2 - 2 = (3)^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 $$

Step 2: Find `x³ + 1/x³`
$$ x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = \left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)^3 - 3\left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right) = (3)^3 - 3(3) = 27 - 9 = 18 $$

Step 3: Find `x⁴ + 1/x⁴`
$$ x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} = \left(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}\right)^2 - 2 = (7)^2 - 2 = 49 - 2 = 47 $$

Step 4: Add the results
$$ (47) + (18) + (7) = 72 $$
**Answer:** $$ 72 $$

### **1. (b) Factorize: x(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) - 24**

**Solution:**
Rearrange and group the terms to find a common expression:
$$ [x(x - 3)][(x - 1)(x - 2)] - 24 $$
$$ (x^2 - 3x)(x^2 - 3x + 2) - 24 $$
Let `y = x^2 - 3x`. The expression becomes:
$$ y(y + 2) - 24 $$
$$ y^2 + 2y - 24 $$
Factor the quadratic in `y`. We need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 2. These are 6 and -4.
$$ (y + 6)(y - 4) $$
Now, substitute back `y = x^2 - 3x`:
$$ (x^2 - 3x + 6)(x^2 - 3x - 4) $$
The second quadratic `x^2 - 3x - 4` can be factored further. We need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to -3. These are -4 and 1.
$$ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) $$
The first quadratic `x^2 - 3x + 6` cannot be factored with real numbers as its discriminant `b²-4ac = (-3)² - 4(1)(6) = 9 - 24 = -15 < 0`.
**Answer:** $$ (x - 4)(x + 1)(x^2 - 3x + 6) $$

### **2. The area of a rectangular plot decreases by 12 m² if the length is increased by 1m and the width is decreased by 1m. Again, the area increases by 54 m² if the length is increased by 3m and the width is increased by 3m.**
**(a) Express the information as algebraic equations.**
**(b) Find the length and width of the plot.**

**Solution:**
Let the length be `L` and the width be `W`. The original area is `A = LW`.

**(a) Algebraic Equations:**
From the first condition:
$$ (L+1)(W-1) = A - 12 $$
$$ LW - L + W - 1 = LW - 12 \implies -L + W = -11 \implies L - W = 11 \quad \text{--- (1)} $$
From the second condition:
$$ (L+3)(W+3) = A + 54 $$
$$ LW + 3L + 3W + 9 = LW + 54 \implies 3L + 3W = 45 \implies L + W = 15 \quad \text{--- (2)} $$
**Answer (a):** `L - W = 11` and `L + W = 15`

**(b) Find Length and Width:**
We have a system of two linear equations:
1. `L - W = 11`
2. `L + W = 15`

Add Equation (1) and (2):
$$ (L - W) + (L + W) = 11 + 15 $$
$$ 2L = 26 \implies L = 13 $$
Substitute `L = 13` into Equation (2):
$$ 13 + W = 15 \implies W = 2 $$
**Answer (b):** Length = 13 meters, Width = 2 meters.

### **3. (a) Solve the equation ax² + bx + c = 0, (a ≠ 0) to find the value of x.**
**(b) Using the derived formula, solve the following equation: x/(x+1) + (x+1)/x = 8**
*(Note: There is a typo in the question. The equation is likely `x/(x+1) + (x+1)/x = some_number`, not 8. And it is not a quadratic equation in its current form. Let's assume the equation to solve is `(x/(x+1))² + 12/(x(x+1)) = 8` which leads to a quadratic, or that the constant is `13/6`, a common variant. Let's solve the equation as written in the OCR: `x(x+1)+12/(x(x+1)) = 8`)*

**Solution:**
**(a) Derivation of the Quadratic Formula:**
Given `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.
$$ x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0 $$
$$ x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a} $$
$$ x^2 + 2\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 $$
$$ \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2} $$
$$ x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
**Answer (a):** $$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

**(b) Solve `x(x+1) + 12/(x(x+1)) = 8`**
Let `y = x(x+1)`. The equation becomes:
$$ y + \frac{12}{y} = 8 $$
Multiply by `y`:
$$ y^2 + 12 = 8y \implies y^2 - 8y + 12 = 0 $$
Factor the quadratic: `(y-6)(y-2) = 0`.
So, `y = 6` or `y = 2`.

Case 1: `y = 6`
`x(x+1) = 6 \implies x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \implies (x+3)(x-2) = 0`. So, `x = -3` or `x = 2`.

Case 2: `y = 2`
`x(x+1) = 2 \implies x^2 + x - 2 = 0 \implies (x+2)(x-1) = 0`. So, `x = -2` or `x = 1`.
**Answer (b):** `x \in \{-3, -2, 1, 2\}`

### **4. The selling price of an item for a retailer is Tk 30,030. The manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer make profits of 4%, 5%, and 10% respectively.**
**(a) Find the cost price for the wholesaler.**
**(b) Find by what percentage the retailer's selling price is higher than the production cost.**

**Solution:**
Let `C_m` be the manufacturer's cost (production cost).
Let `C_w` be the wholesaler's cost.
Let `C_r` be the retailer's cost.
Let `S_r` be the retailer's selling price = 30,030.

We have: `S_r = C_r \times (1 + 10\%) = 1.10 C_r`
`C_r = S_w = C_w \times (1 + 5\%) = 1.05 C_w`
`C_w = S_m = C_m \times (1 + 4\%) = 1.04 C_m`

**(a) Wholesaler's Cost Price (C_w):**
First find the retailer's cost `C_r`:
`30030 = 1.10 C_r \implies C_r = 30030 / 1.10 = 27300`.
Now use this to find the wholesaler's cost `C_w`:
`C_r = 1.05 C_w \implies 27300 = 1.05 C_w \implies C_w = 27300 / 1.05 = 26000`.
**Answer (a):** The wholesaler's cost price is Tk 26,000.

**(b) Percentage Markup over Production Cost:**
First find the production cost `C_m`:
`C_w = 1.04 C_m \implies 26000 = 1.04 C_m \implies C_m = 26000 / 1.04 = 25000`.
Percentage increase = `((S_r - C_m) / C_m) \times 100%`
`= ((30030 - 25000) / 25000) \times 100%`
`= (5030 / 25000) \times 100% = 0.2012 \times 100% = 20.12%`.
**Answer (b):** The retailer's selling price is 20.12% higher than the production cost.

### **5. (a) By selling a notebook for Tk 36, the loss incurred is double the profit that would have been made by selling it for Tk 72. What is the cost price of the notebook?**

**Solution:**
Let the cost price be `C`.
Loss when sold for 36 = `C - 36`.
Profit when sold for 72 = `72 - C`.
Given: `Loss = 2 * Profit`
$$ C - 36 = 2(72 - C) $$
$$ C - 36 = 144 - 2C $$
$$ 3C = 144 + 36 = 180 $$
$$ C = 180 / 3 = 60 $$
**Answer:** The cost price is Tk 60.

### **5. (b) A bus was hired for Tk 5700 for a picnic on the condition that every passenger would pay an equal share. As 5 passengers did not go, the per-head fare increased by Tk 3. How many passengers went on the bus?**

**Solution:**
Let the original number of passengers be `x` and the original fare be `y`.
1. `xy = 5700`
2. `(x - 5)(y + 3) = 5700`

From (1), `y = 5700/x`. Substitute into (2):
$$ (x - 5)\left(\frac{5700}{x} + 3\right) = 5700 $$
$$ 5700 + 3x - \frac{28500}{x} - 15 = 5700 $$
$$ 3x - \frac{28500}{x} - 15 = 0 $$
Multiply by `x` and divide by 3:
$$ x^2 - 5x - 9500 = 0 $$
We need two numbers that multiply to -9500 and add to -5. These are -100 and 95.
$$ (x - 100)(x + 95) = 0 $$
Since `x > 0`, the original number of passengers was `x = 100`.
The number of passengers who actually went = `x - 5 = 100 - 5 = 95`.
**Answer:** 95 passengers went on the bus.

### **6. In an exam of 60 students, 25 failed in Bangla, 24 in English, and 32 in Math. 9 failed in Bangla only, 6 in English only, 5 in English & Math, and 3 in Bangla & English.**
*(Note: There is an ambiguity. "5 in English & Math" could mean "only E&M" or "E&M and possibly B". Similarly for "3 in Bangla & English". Let's assume the latter for standard Venn diagram problems.)*
**How many failed in three subjects and how many passed in three subjects?**

**Solution:**
Total `T=60`. Let `B, E, M` be the sets of students who failed.
`n(B)=25, n(E)=24, n(M)=32`
`n(B only) = n(B) - n(B∩E) - n(B∩M) + n(B∩E∩M) = 9`
`n(E only) = n(E) - n(B∩E) - n(E∩M) + n(B∩E∩M) = 6`
`n(E∩M) = 5`, `n(B∩E) = 3`
Let `n(B∩E∩M) = x`.
`n(E∩M only) = n(E∩M) - x = 5-x`.
`n(B∩E only) = n(B∩E) - x = 3-x`.

From the `n(E only)` formula:
`24 - n(B∩E) - n(E∩M) + x = 6` is incorrect. The formula is `n(E only) = n(E) - n(E∩(B∪M))`.
Let's use a Venn Diagram.
Let the region for all three be `x`.
Region E&M only is `5-x`. Region B&E only is `3-x`.
Let Region B&M only be `y`.
Then `n(B only) = 25 - (3-x) - y - x = 25 - 3 + x - y - x = 22-y = 9 \implies y=13`.
`n(E only) = 24 - (3-x) - (5-x) - x = 24 - 3 + x - 5 + x - x = 16+x = 6 \implies x=-10`.
This is impossible. The question data is contradictory. "5 in English & Math" must mean **"5 in English & Math but not Bangla"**.

**Re-solving with "only" interpretation:**
`n(B only)=9, n(E only)=6, n(E∩M only)=5, n(B∩E only)=3`.
Let `n(B∩E∩M) = x` and `n(B∩M only) = y`.
`n(B) = n(B only) + n(B∩E only) + n(B∩M only) + n(B∩E∩M) = 9+3+y+x = 25 \implies x+y=13`.
`n(E) = n(E only) + n(B∩E only) + n(E∩M only) + n(B∩E∩M) = 6+3+5+x = 24 \implies 14+x=24 \implies x=10`.
From `x+y=13`, `10+y=13 \implies y=3`.
Now check with `n(M)`:
`n(M) = n(M only) + n(B∩M only) + n(E∩M only) + n(B∩E∩M) = n(M only) + 3 + 5 + 10 = n(M only) + 18 = 32 \implies n(M only)=14`.
Total failed = `n(B only)+n(E only)+n(M only) + n(B∩E only)+n(E∩M only)+n(B∩M only) + n(B∩E∩M)`
`= 9+6+14 + 3+5+3 + 10 = 50`.
Students who failed in three subjects = `x = 10`.
Students who passed in three subjects = `Total - Total failed = 60 - 50 = 10`.
**Answer:** 10 students failed in three subjects, and 10 students passed in three subjects.

### **7. (a) Show that 1/3 = 2(1/8 + 1/24 + 1/80 + ... ∞)**
*(Note: There is a typo in the question. A known series is `1 = 2(1/2 + 1/8 + 1/24 + ...)` or `1/3 = 2(1/15 + 1/63 + ...)` based on `4n³-3n`. Let's assume the question is a telescoping series, `1 = 2 * sum[1/((2n-1)(2n+1))]` is a known result. Let's try to find the pattern `8, 24, 80... \implies 3²-1, 5²-1, 9²-1`. This is not a standard AP or GP in the denominator. A likely series is `1/(n(n+2))`)*.
The question as written is likely flawed. The infinite sum on the right is non-standard and difficult to evaluate.

### **7. (b) How many permutations can be made with the letters of the word COURAGE, such that each permutation begins with a vowel?**

**Solution:**
The word is COURAGE. Total letters = 7.
The vowels are O, U, A, E. (4 vowels)
The consonants are C, R, G. (3 consonants)
The condition is that the first letter must be a vowel.
This is a permutation of 7 distinct letters.

Step 1: Choose the first letter.
There are 4 choices for the first position (it must be one of O, U, A, E).

Step 2: Arrange the remaining letters.
After placing a vowel in the first position, we have `7 - 1 = 6` letters remaining to be arranged in the remaining `6` positions.
The number of ways to arrange these 6 distinct letters is `6!`.
$$6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720$$

Step 3: Total number of permutations.
Total permutations = (Choices for 1st position) × (Arrangements for the rest)
`= 4 \times 6! = 4 \times 720 = 2880`.
**Answer:** 2880 permutations can be made.

### **8. 500 people surveyed: 50 do not read Observer, 25 do not read Ittefaq. 10 read neither. What is the probability that a randomly chosen person reads Ittefaq but not Observer?**

**Solution:**
Total `N=500`. Let `O` be the set of Observer readers, `I` be the set of Ittefaq readers.
`n(O') = 50 \implies n(O) = 500 - 50 = 450`.
`n(I') = 25 \implies n(I) = 500 - 25 = 475`.
`n(O' ∩ I') = n((O∪I)') = 10`.
`n(O∪I) = N - n((O∪I)') = 500 - 10 = 490`.
We also know `n(O∪I) = n(O) + n(I) - n(O∩I)`.
`490 = 450 + 475 - n(O∩I) \implies 490 = 925 - n(O∩I) \implies n(O∩I) = 435`.
We need the number of people who read Ittefaq but not Observer, which is `n(I \ O)`.
`n(I \ O) = n(I) - n(I∩O) = 475 - 435 = 40`.
The required probability is `P(I \ O) = n(I \ O) / N = 40 / 500 = 4/50 = 2/25`.
**Answer:** $$ 2/25 $$

### **9. (a) Show that sec⁴A - sec²A = tan⁴A + tan²A.**
**Solution:**
LHS = `sec⁴A - sec²A = sec²A(sec²A - 1)`.
Using the identity `sec²A = 1 + tan²A`, we have `sec²A - 1 = tan²A`.
LHS = `(1 + tan²A)(tan²A) = tan²A + tan⁴A` = RHS.
**Hence, proved.**

### **9. (b) A 64m long pole breaks and touches the ground, making a 60° angle. Find the length of the broken part.**
**Solution:**
Let the total height be `H=64`. Let the pole break at height `h` from the ground.
The broken part has length `x = 64 - h`. This part forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
In the triangle, the height is `h` and the hypotenuse is `x`. The angle with the ground is 60°.
`sin(60°) = opposite / hypotenuse = h / x`.
`√3/2 = h / (64 - h)`
`√3(64 - h) = 2h`
`64√3 - h√3 = 2h`
`64√3 = 2h + h√3 = h(2+√3)`
`h = 64√3 / (2+√3)`.
The length of the broken part is `x = 64 - h`. This is complex. Let's reconsider the variables.
Let the broken part be `x`. The remaining standing part is `64-x`.
The height of the triangle is `64-x`, hypotenuse is `x`.
`sin(60°) = (64-x) / x`
`√3/2 = (64-x) / x`
`x√3 = 2(64-x) = 128 - 2x`
`x√3 + 2x = 128 \implies x(√3+2) = 128`
`x = 128 / (2+√3) = 128(2-√3) / (4-3) = 128(2-√3)`.
`x ≈ 128(2 - 1.732) = 128(0.268) ≈ 34.304` m.
**Answer:** $$ 128(2-\sqrt{3}) \text{ m} \approx 34.3 \text{ m} $$

### **10. In △ABC, AB=BC=CA=a, and AD is the median to side BC.**
**(a) Show that Area(△ABD) = Area(△ACD).**
**(b) Prove that Area(△ABC) = (√3/4)a².**

**Solution:**
**(a)** A median divides a triangle into two triangles of equal area. AD is the median to BC, so D is the midpoint.
Area(△ABD) = `(1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * BD * h`.
Area(△ACD) = `(1/2) * CD * h`.
Since `BD=CD`, Area(△ABD) = Area(△ACD). **Hence, proved.**

**(b)** In an equilateral triangle, the median AD is also the altitude.
In right `△ABD`, `AB=a`, `BD = a/2`.
By Pythagoras theorem, `AD² = AB² - BD² = a² - (a/2)² = a² - a²/4 = 3a²/4`.
`AD = (√3/2)a`.
Area(△ABC) = `(1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * BC * AD = (1/2) * a * (√3/2)a = (√3/4)a²`. **Hence, proved.**

### **11. Given the diagram.**
**(a) Find the value of ∠CAD.**
**(b) Show that BC:AD = 1:2√3.** *(Note: the image seems to show a typo, likely should be BD:AD or something similar. Let's solve as written)*

**Solution:**
In `△ABD`, `∠D=90°` (implied by the square symbol), `∠B=30°`. `∠BAD = 180-90-30=60°`.
In `△ADC`, `∠D=90°`, `∠C=60°`. `∠CAD = 180-90-60=30°`.
**Answer (a):** `∠CAD = 30°`.
Let AD = `h`.
In `△ABD`, `tan(30°) = AD/BD = h/BD \implies BD = h/tan(30°) = h/(1/√3) = h√3`.
In `△ADC`, `tan(60°) = AD/CD = h/CD \implies CD = h/tan(60°) = h/√3`.
`BC = BD + CD = h√3 + h/√3 = (3h+h)/√3 = 4h/√3`.
The ratio `BC:AD = (4h/√3) : h = 4/√3 : 1`. This is not `1:2√3`. The diagram or question is flawed.
If we assume `AC=4cm` is given, in `△ADC`, `sin(60°)=AD/AC \implies √3/2=h/4 \implies h=2√3`.
Then `CD = 2`. And `BD = h√3 = 2√3*√3=6`. `BC = 6+2=8`.
`BC:AD = 8 : 2√3 = 4 : √3`.
**The problem statement as given has contradictions.**

### **12. The three vertices of a triangle are A(-2,0), B(5,1), and C(1,4).**
**(a) Show that △ABC is an isosceles right triangle.**
**(b) Find the area of △ABC using the coordinates of the vertices.**

**Solution:**
**(a)** Find the lengths of the sides using the distance formula `d = √((x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²)`
`AB² = (5 - (-2))² + (1-0)² = 7² + 1² = 50`.
`BC² = (1 - 5)² + (4-1)² = (-4)² + 3² = 16+9 = 25`.
`AC² = (1 - (-2))² + (4-0)² = 3² + 4² = 9+16 = 25`.
Since `BC² = AC² = 25`, the triangle is isosceles.
Check for right angle: `BC² + AC² = 25 + 25 = 50 = AB²`.
Since `BC² + AC² = AB²`, by the converse of Pythagoras theorem, the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle at C. **Hence, shown.**

**(b)** Area = `(1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * BC * AC = (1/2) * √25 * √25 = (1/2) * 5 * 5 = 12.5`.
Using the coordinate formula:
Area = `(1/2) |x₁(y₂-y₃) + x₂(y₃-y₁) + x₃(y₁-y₂)|`
`= (1/2) |-2(1-4) + 5(4-0) + 1(0-1)| = (1/2) |-2(-3) + 5(4) + 1(-1)| = (1/2) |6+20-1| = (1/2)|25|=12.5`.
**Answer (b):** $$ 12.5 \text{ sq. units} $$

### **13. AD, BE, CF are the three medians of △ABC. Prove that (AB+BC+CA) > (AD+BE+CF).**

**Solution:**
In any triangle, the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
Consider `△ABD`, `AB+BD > AD`.
Consider `△ACD`, `AC+CD > AD`.
Adding these: `AB+AC+BC > 2AD`.
Similarly, for median BE: `BA+BC > 2BE`.
And for median CF: `CA+CB > 2CF`.
Adding the three resulting inequalities:
`(AB+AC+BC) + (BA+BC) + (CA+CB) > 2AD + 2BE + 2CF`
`2AB + 2BC + 2CA > 2(AD+BE+CF)`
`AB+BC+CA > AD+BE+CF`. **Hence, proved.**

### **14. U = {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}, A = {x | x is a multiple of 3 and x < 12}.**
**(a) Find A × A'.**
**(b) Find n(A∪A') and n(A∩A') using the element count formula.**

**Solution:**
From the universal set U, `A = {3, 6, 9}`.
`A' = U \ A = {5, 7}`.
**(a)** `A × A' = {(3,5), (3,7), (6,5), (6,7), (9,5), (9,7)}`.
**(b)** `A∪A' = U = {3,5,6,7,9}`. So `n(A∪A') = 5`.
`A∩A' = ∅` (the empty set). So `n(A∩A') = 0`.
Using formulas: `n(A)=3, n(A')=2`.
`n(A∪A') = n(A) + n(A') - n(A∩A')`.
Since `A∩A'` is empty, `n(A∩A')=0`.
`n(A∪A') = 3 + 2 - 0 = 5`.
**Answers:**
**(a)** $$ A \times A' = \{(3,5), (3,7), (6,5), (6,7), (9,5), (9,7)\} $$
**(b)** $$ n(A \cup A') = 5, \quad n(A \cap A') = 0 $$
