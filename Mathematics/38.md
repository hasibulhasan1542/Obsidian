Of course. Here are the detailed solutions for all the math problems from the provided exam paper, presented in mathematical format.

### **1. (a) If x - 1/x = √3, find the value of x⁶ + 1/x⁶.**

**Solution:**
First, we find `x² + 1/x²`.
$$ \left(x - \frac{1}{x}\right)^2 = (\sqrt{3})^2 \implies x^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 3 \implies x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 5 $$
Next, we find `x³ - 1/x³`, but it's easier to cube `x² + 1/x²`. Let `y = x²`. We need to find `y³ + 1/y³`.
Using the identity `a³ + b³ = (a+b)³ - 3ab(a+b)`:
$$ (x^2)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^3 = \left(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}\right)^3 - 3x^2 \frac{1}{x^2} \left(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}\right) $$
$$ x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (5)^3 - 3(1)(5) = 125 - 15 = 110 $$
**Answer:** $$ 110 $$

### **1. (b) Solve: 1/(a+b+x) = 1/a + 1/b + 1/x**

**Solution:**
$$ \frac{1}{a+b+x} - \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} $$
Combine terms on each side:
$$ \frac{x - (a+b+x)}{x(a+b+x)} = \frac{b+a}{ab} $$
$$ \frac{- (a+b)}{x(a+b+x)} = \frac{a+b}{ab} $$
Assuming `a+b ≠ 0`, we can divide both sides by `(a+b)`:
$$ \frac{-1}{x(a+b+x)} = \frac{1}{ab} $$
Cross-multiply:
$$ -ab = x(a+b+x) = ax + bx + x^2 $$
$$ x^2 + (a+b)x + ab = 0 $$
Factor the quadratic:
$$ (x+a)(x+b) = 0 $$
The solutions are `x = -a` or `x = -b`.
**Answer:** $$ x = -a, -b $$

### **2. Factorize:**
**(a) 54x⁴ + 27x³a - 16x - 8a**

**Solution:**
Group the terms:
$$ (54x^4 + 27x^3a) - (16x + 8a) $$
Factor out the common terms from each group:
$$ 27x^3(2x + a) - 8(2x + a) $$
Factor out the common binomial `(2x + a)`:
$$ (2x + a)(27x^3 - 8) $$
The second term is a difference of cubes, `(3x)³ - (2)³`:
$$ (2x + a)((3x)^3 - 2^3) = (2x + a)(3x - 2)((3x)^2 + (3x)(2) + 2^2) $$
**Answer:** $$ (2x + a)(3x - 2)(9x^2 + 6x + 4) $$

**(b) 12x² + 35x + 18**

**Solution:**
We need to find two numbers that multiply to `12 \times 18 = 216` and add to `35`.
The factors of 216 are (1, 216), (2, 108), (3, 72), (4, 54), (6, 36), (8, 27).
The pair `8` and `27` sums to 35. So we split the middle term:
$$ 12x^2 + 27x + 8x + 18 $$
Group the terms:
$$ (12x^2 + 27x) + (8x + 18) $$
Factor out the common terms:
$$ 3x(4x + 9) + 2(4x + 9) $$
Factor out the common binomial `(4x + 9)`:
**Answer:** $$ (4x + 9)(3x + 2) $$

### **3. A shopkeeper sells two shirts at the same price. He makes a 10% profit on one and a 10% loss on the other. What is his overall percentage profit or loss?**

**Solution:**
Let the selling price of each shirt be `S`. Total selling price = `2S`.
Let the cost price of the first shirt be `C₁`. Profit = 10%.
`S = C₁ \times (1 + 10\%) = 1.1 C₁ \implies C₁ = S / 1.1`
Let the cost price of the second shirt be `C₂`. Loss = 10%.
`S = C₂ \times (1 - 10\%) = 0.9 C₂ \implies C₂ = S / 0.9`
Total Cost Price = `C₁ + C₂ = S/1.1 + S/0.9 = S(10/11 + 10/9) = S((90+110)/99) = 200S/99`.
Overall Loss = Total Cost - Total Selling Price = `200S/99 - 2S = S(200/99 - 2) = S((200-198)/99) = 2S/99`.
Percentage Loss = `(Overall Loss / Total Cost) \times 100%`
`= ((2S/99) / (200S/99)) \times 100% = (2/200) \times 100% = 1%`.
**Answer:** $$ 1\% \text{ loss} $$

### **4. (a) If 7sin²θ + 3cos²θ = 4, find the value of tanθ.**

**Solution:**
`7sin²θ + 3(1 - sin²θ) = 4`
`7sin²θ + 3 - 3sin²θ = 4`
`4sin²θ = 1 \implies sin²θ = 1/4 \implies sinθ = ±1/2`
`cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 \implies cosθ = ±√3/2`
`tan²θ = sin²θ / cos²θ = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3`
`tanθ = ±\sqrt{1/3} = ±1/√3`
**Answer:** $$ \tan\theta = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $$

**(b) If sinθ/x = cosθ/y, prove that sinθ - cosθ = (x-y)/√(x²+y²).**

**Solution:**
Let `sinθ/x = cosθ/y = k`. Then `sinθ = kx` and `cosθ = ky`.
We know `sin²θ + cos²θ = 1`.
`(kx)² + (ky)² = 1 \implies k²(x²+y²) = 1 \implies k = ±1/√(x²+y²)`.
`sinθ - cosθ = kx - ky = k(x-y)`.
Substitute the value of `k`:
`sinθ - cosθ = (±1/√(x²+y²))(x-y)`. The question requires the positive case.
**Answer:** $$ \sin\theta - \cos\theta = \frac{x-y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \quad (\text{assuming k is positive}) $$

### **5. Find the smallest three-digit prime number whose sum of digits is 11 and each digit is a prime number.**

**Solution:**
The single-digit prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7.
We need three of these digits that sum to 11.
Possible combinations:
*   `2 + 2 + 7 = 11` (Digits: 2, 2, 7)
*   `3 + 3 + 5 = 11` (Digits: 3, 3, 5)
Possible numbers to check for primality (we want the smallest):
From (2,2,7): 227, 272 (not prime), 722 (not prime).
Is 227 prime? Check for divisibility by primes up to `√227 ≈ 15`. Primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.
227 is not divisible by 2, 3 (sum=11), 5. `227/7=32 R 3`. `227/11=20 R 7`. `227/13=17 R 6`. So, 227 is prime.
From (3,3,5): 335 (divisible by 5), 353, 533.
Is 353 prime? `353/7=50 R 3`, `353/11=32 R 1`, `353/13=27 R 2`, `353/17=20 R 13`. So, 353 is prime.
Is 533 prime? `533/13 = 41`. So, 533 is not prime.
The smallest prime number found is 227.
**Answer:** The number is 227. Justification: It is the smallest number formed from the two valid digit sets (2,2,7 and 3,3,5), and it is a prime number.

### **6. Solve: 4ˣ - 3(2ˣ⁺²) + 2⁵ = 0**

**Solution:**
$$ (2^2)^x - 3(2^x \cdot 2^2) + 32 = 0 $$
$$ (2^x)^2 - 3(4 \cdot 2^x) + 32 = 0 $$
$$ (2^x)^2 - 12(2^x) + 32 = 0 $$
Let `y = 2^x`. The equation becomes a quadratic in `y`:
$$ y^2 - 12y + 32 = 0 $$
Factor the quadratic. We need two numbers that multiply to 32 and add to -12. These are -4 and -8.
$$ (y - 4)(y - 8) = 0 $$
So, `y = 4` or `y = 8`.
Case 1: `2^x = y = 4 = 2² \implies x = 2`.
Case 2: `2^x = y = 8 = 2³ \implies x = 3`.
**Answer:** $$ x = 2, 3 $$

---
### **7. (a) Prove that logₐ(Πᵢ₌₁ⁿ xᵢ) = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ logₐ xᵢ**

**Solution:**
This is the product rule for logarithms extended to `n` terms.
Let `Πᵢ₌₁ⁿ xᵢ = x₁ \cdot x₂ \cdot ... \cdot xₙ`.
$$ \log_a(\Pi_{i=1}^{n} x_i) = \log_a(x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot ... \cdot x_n) $$
By the basic logarithm product rule `log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)`, we can expand this:
$$ = \log_a(x_1) + \log_a(x_2 \cdot ... \cdot x_n) $$
$$ = \log_a(x_1) + \log_a(x_2) + \log_a(x_3 \cdot ... \cdot x_n) $$
Continuing this expansion `n-1` times, we get:
$$ = \log_a(x_1) + \log_a(x_2) + ... + \log_a(x_n) $$
This sum is represented by the sigma notation:
$$ = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log_a x_i $$
**Hence, proved.**

**(b) If a = xyᵖ⁻¹, b = xy۹⁻¹, c = xyʳ⁻¹, prove that a۹⁻ʳ bʳ⁻ᵖ cᵖ⁻۹ = 1.**

**Solution:**
Substitute the expressions for a, b, and c into the LHS:
$$ (xy^{p-1})^{q-r} \cdot (xy^{q-1})^{r-p} \cdot (xy^{r-1})^{p-q} $$
Distribute the exponents:
$$ (x^{q-r} y^{(p-1)(q-r)}) \cdot (x^{r-p} y^{(q-1)(r-p)}) \cdot (x^{p-q} y^{(r-1)(p-q)}) $$
Group the x and y terms:
$$ x^{(q-r) + (r-p) + (p-q)} \cdot y^{(p-1)(q-r) + (q-1)(r-p) + (r-1)(p-q)} $$
The exponent of x is `q-r+r-p+p-q = 0`. So `x⁰ = 1`.
The exponent of y is `(pq-pr-q+r) + (qr-qp-r+p) + (rp-rq-p+q)`.
Combine the terms: `(pq-qp) + (qr-rq) + (rp-pr) + (p-p) + (q-q) + (r-r) = 0`. So `y⁰ = 1`.
The expression equals `x⁰ \cdot y⁰ = 1 \cdot 1 = 1`.
**Answer:** $$ 1 $$

### **8. If for compound interest, the annual interest rates for the first, second, and third years are r₁%, r₂%, and r₃% respectively, then what is the total compounded amount for P Taka after three years?**

**Solution:**
Let `A_n` be the amount after `n` years.
Amount after 1st year: `A_1 = P(1 + r_1/100)`.
Amount after 2nd year: `A_2 = A_1(1 + r_2/100) = P(1 + r_1/100)(1 + r_2/100)`.
Amount after 3rd year: `A_3 = A_2(1 + r_3/100) = P(1 + r_1/100)(1 + r_2/100)(1 + r_3/100)`.
**Answer:** $$ P\left(1 + \frac{r_1}{100}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r_2}{100}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r_3}{100}\right) $$

### **9. Find the distance of the point (-2, 0) from the straight line passing through (1, 2) and (-3, 5).**

**Solution:**
First, find the equation of the line passing through `(1, 2)` and `(-3, 5)`.
Slope `m = (5-2)/(-3-1) = 3/-4 = -3/4`.
Using point-slope form `y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)`:
`y - 2 = -3/4 (x - 1)`
`4(y-2) = -3(x-1) \implies 4y-8 = -3x+3 \implies 3x + 4y - 11 = 0`.
The distance from a point `(x₀, y₀)` to a line `Ax+By+C=0` is `d = |Ax₀+By₀+C| / √(A²+B²)`.
Here, point is `(-2, 0)` and line is `3x+4y-11=0`.
$$ d = \frac{|3(-2) + 4(0) - 11|}{\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = \frac{|-6 + 0 - 11|}{\sqrt{9+16}} = \frac{|-17|}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{17}{5} $$
**Answer:** $$ \frac{17}{5} \text{ or } 3.4 \text{ units} $$

### **10. Among 200 candidates, 40 failed in Math, 20 in Statistics, and 10 in both. A candidate is chosen at random. What is the probability that he/she (a) failed in Math and passed in Statistics; (b) passed in only one subject; (c) passed in at most one subject?**

**Solution:**
Total `T=200`. Let `M` be failed in Math, `S` be failed in Stats.
`n(M)=40, n(S)=20, n(M∩S)=10`.
Total failed `n(M∪S) = n(M)+n(S)-n(M∩S) = 40+20-10 = 50`.
Total passed `n(P) = T - n(M∪S) = 200 - 50 = 150`.
`n(M only) = n(M)-n(M∩S) = 40-10=30`.
`n(S only) = n(S)-n(M∩S) = 20-10=10`.

(a) Failed in Math and passed in Stats: This is `n(M only)`.
`P(M \text{ and } S') = n(M \text{ only}) / T = 30/200 = 3/20`.

(b) Passed in only one subject: This is `n(M only)` (passed Stats, failed Math) + `n(S only)` (passed Math, failed Stats).
`n(passed only one) = n(M \text{ only}) + n(S \text{ only}) = 30 + 10 = 40`.
`P(passed only one) = 40/200 = 1/5`.

(c) Passed in at most one subject: This means passed in zero subjects (failed both) OR passed in only one subject.
`n(passed zero) = n(M∩S) = 10`.
`n(at most one pass) = n(passed zero) + n(passed only one) = 10 + 40 = 50`.
`P(at most one pass) = 50/200 = 1/4`.
**Answers:** $$ \text{(a) } \frac{3}{20} \quad \text{(b) } \frac{1}{5} \quad \text{(c) } \frac{1}{4} $$

### **11. (a) In how many ways can the letters of the word MATHEMATICS be arranged?**

**Solution:**
The word MATHEMATICS has 11 letters.
Repeated letters: M (2 times), A (2 times), T (2 times).
The other letters (H, E, I, C, S) appear once.
The number of distinct permutations of `n` objects where there are `n₁` identical objects of type 1, `n₂` of type 2, etc., is `n! / (n₁! n₂! ... nk!)`.
$$ \text{Arrangements} = \frac{11!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{39,916,800}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{39,916,800}{8} = 4,989,600 $$
**Answer:** $$ 4,989,600 $$

**(b) Find the possible number of combinations of 4 letters from the word COMBINATION.**

**Solution:**
The word is COMBINATION. Letters: C(1), O(2), M(1), B(1), I(2), N(2), A(1), T(1).
Total 11 letters, 8 distinct types.

Case 1: All 4 letters are distinct.
Choose 4 distinct types from the 8 available: `⁸C₄ = 70`.
Case 2: 2 letters are alike, 2 are distinct.
Choose 1 pair from the 3 available pairs (O, I, N): `³C₁ = 3`.
Choose 2 distinct letters from the remaining 7 types: `⁷C₂ = 21`.
Total for this case = `3 * 21 = 63`.
Case 3: 2 letters are alike, the other 2 are also alike (two pairs).
Choose 2 pairs from the 3 available pairs: `³C₂ = 3`.
Total combinations = Case 1 + Case 2 + Case 3 = `70 + 63 + 3 = 136`.
**Answer:** $$ 136 $$

### **12. A conical cup is made by bending a semicircular metal sheet of diameter 28 cm. Find the depth and capacity of the cup.**

**Solution:**
Diameter of semicircle = 28 cm, so its radius `R = 14` cm.
This radius `R` becomes the slant height `l` of the cone. `l = 14` cm.
The circumference of the base of the cone is the length of the arc of the semicircle.
Arc length = `πR = 14π` cm.
Let the radius of the cone's base be `r`. Circumference of base = `2πr`.
`2πr = 14π \implies r = 7` cm.
The depth (height) `h` of the cone is found by Pythagoras theorem: `l² = r² + h²`.
`14² = 7² + h² \implies 196 = 49 + h² \implies h² = 147`.
`h = \sqrt{147} = \sqrt{49 \times 3} = 7\sqrt{3}` cm.
Capacity (Volume) of the cone `V = (1/3)πr²h`.
`V = (1/3)π(7²)(7√3) = (1/3)π(49)(7√3) = (343π√3)/3` cm³.
`V ≈ (343 \times 3.14159 \times 1.732) / 3 ≈ 622.37` cm³.
**Answers:**
*   Depth (height) = $$ 7\sqrt{3} \text{ cm} $$
*   Capacity (volume) = $$ \frac{343\pi\sqrt{3}}{3} \text{ cm}^3 \approx 622.37 \text{ cm}^3 $$
