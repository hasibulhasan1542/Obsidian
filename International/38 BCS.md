Of course. Here are the detailed, data-rich answers for all the short answer questions in Question 01 from the "International Affairs" paper (`./21.jpg`), as requested.

### **Question 01: Answer any 10 of the following questions in brief: (4x10=40)**

#### **(a) What is meant by a multinational state?**

**Answer:**
A **multinational state** is a sovereign state that is composed of two or more nations or ethnic groups who coexist within its borders. Unlike a nation-state, where the vast majority of the population shares a single, common national identity, a multinational state is characterized by its cultural, linguistic, and ethnic diversity.

In such states, different national groups often maintain their distinct identities and may seek some form of political autonomy or recognition. The stability of a multinational state often depends on its ability to manage these diverse identities and ensure equitable representation and rights for all groups.

*   **Examples:**
    *   **The United Kingdom** is a classic example, as it is composed of four distinct nations: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
    *   **India** is another prime example, with its vast diversity of languages, religions, and ethnic groups.
    *   Other examples include **Canada** (with its English and French-speaking populations), **Russia**, and **Spain**.

#### **(b) What are the main components of human security?**

**Answer:**
**Human security** is a people-centric approach to security that challenges the traditional state-centric concept of national security (which focuses on protecting the state from external military threats). Human security argues that the proper referent for security should be the individual, and its goal is to protect the "vital core of all human lives in ways that enhance human freedoms and human fulfillment."

The **United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)**, in its 1994 Human Development Report, identified **seven main components** of human security:

1.  **Economic Security:** Assured basic income, protection from poverty and unemployment.
2.  **Food Security:** Physical and economic access to basic food at all times.
3.  **Health Security:** Protection from diseases and access to necessary healthcare.
4.  **Environmental Security:** Protection from natural disasters, environmental degradation, and pollution.
5.  **Personal Security:** Protection from physical violence, whether from the state, other states, or from individuals (e.g., crime, domestic violence).
6.  **Community Security:** Protection from the loss of traditional relationships and values, and from sectarian and ethnic violence.
7.  **Political Security:** Ensuring that people live in a society that honors their basic human rights and provides freedom from political oppression.

#### **(c) What is the main proposition of the Democratic Peace Theory?**

**Answer:**
The **main proposition** of the **Democratic Peace Theory** is that **democracies do not go to war with other democracies**. This is one of the most widely cited and empirically supported claims in international relations.

The theory does not argue that democracies are inherently more peaceful in general—they do engage in wars with non-democratic states. The claim is specific to their interactions with each other.

There are two main explanations for this phenomenon:
1.  **Normative Explanation:** Democracies are based on internal norms of peaceful conflict resolution, compromise, and respect for individual rights. When dealing with other democracies, leaders tend to apply these same norms externally, preferring negotiation and diplomacy over the use of force.
2.  **Institutional Explanation:** The institutional structures of a democracy—such as checks and balances, the separation of powers, and the need for public and parliamentary approval—make it difficult for leaders to declare war, especially against other states where similar constraints exist. The transparency of democratic processes and the free press also create accountability, as leaders are answerable to a public that typically bears the costs of war.

#### **(d) What is meant by a crime against humanity? Give an example.**

**Answer:**
A **crime against humanity** refers to certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a **widespread or systematic attack** directed against any **civilian population**. The key feature is that these are not random, isolated acts of violence, but part of a larger state or organizational policy.

Unlike war crimes, a crime against humanity can be committed during times of both **peace and war**. The concept was first legally defined during the Nuremberg Trials after World War II.

According to the **Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC)**, acts that constitute crimes against humanity include:
*   Murder
*   Extermination
*   Enslavement
*   Deportation or forcible transfer of population
*   Torture
*   Rape, sexual slavery, and other forms of sexual violence
*   Persecution against an identifiable group
*   Apartheid
*   Enforced disappearance

**Example:**
The **genocide in Rwanda in 1994**, where Hutu extremists systematically slaughtered an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus, is a horrific and clear-cut example of multiple crimes against humanity, including extermination and persecution.

#### **(e) What is the difference between 'territory' and 'territorial integrity'?**

**Answer:**
While related, 'territory' and 'territorial integrity' are distinct concepts in international law and politics.

*   **Territory:** This is a geographical concept. It refers to the **physical, defined geographical area**—land, water, and airspace—that is under the jurisdiction and control of a sovereign state. A state's territory is one of its fundamental defining characteristics, along with a permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.

*   **Territorial Integrity:** This is a legal and political principle. It is the principle under international law that **nation-states should not attempt to promote secessionist movements or to annex another state's territory**. It is the right of a sovereign state to have its borders and territory respected and to be free from external aggression or violation. This principle is enshrined in **Article 2(4) of the UN Charter**, which prohibits the "threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."

In short, **territory is the physical space** a state occupies, while **territorial integrity is the legal right** to have that space protected from violation by other states.

#### **(f) Briefly discuss the characteristics of a developing country.**

**Answer:**
A **developing country** is a sovereign state with a less developed industrial base and a lower Human Development Index (HDI) relative to other countries. The term is used to describe nations that are in the process of building a more advanced and stable economy.

Key characteristics include:
1.  **Low Gross National Income (GNI) per capita:** They generally have a low level of income per person compared to developed nations.
2.  **Dependence on Agriculture:** The economy is often heavily reliant on agriculture and the export of primary commodities, with a less developed industrial and service sector.
3.  **High Levels of Poverty and Inequality:** A significant portion of the population lives below the poverty line, and there are often large disparities in wealth and income.
4.  **Low Human Development Indicators:** They typically have lower levels of life expectancy, literacy rates, and educational attainment compared to developed countries.
5.  **High Population Growth and Unemployment:** Developing countries often have high birth rates and a large youth population, leading to challenges in creating sufficient employment opportunities.
6.  **Political and Institutional Weakness:** They may suffer from political instability, weak governance, corruption, and underdeveloped state institutions.
7.  **Vulnerability to External Shocks:** Their economies are often more vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices, financial crises, and the impacts of climate change.

---
#### **(g) What is the concept of 'Global Commons'?**

**Answer:**
The **Global Commons** refers to resource domains or areas that lie **outside the political jurisdiction of any single state** and to which all nations have legal access. These are areas that are shared by all of humanity. The management and protection of the Global Commons require international cooperation and governance.

The four universally recognized Global Commons are:
1.  **The High Seas:** The parts of the ocean that are not included in the territorial sea or internal waters of a state. Their use is governed by the principle of freedom of the seas, codified in the **UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)**.
2.  **The Atmosphere:** The Earth's atmosphere, which no country owns but all depend on for survival. Its protection from pollution and greenhouse gas emissions is a global concern addressed by treaties like the Paris Agreement.
3.  **Antarctica:** The continent is governed by the **Antarctic Treaty System (1959)**, which designates it as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science, prohibiting military activity and territorial claims.
4.  **Outer Space:** The space beyond the Earth's atmosphere is considered the "province of all mankind." Its exploration and use are governed by the **Outer Space Treaty (1967)**, which forbids any nation from claiming sovereignty over celestial bodies.

Some analysts now also argue for the inclusion of **cyberspace** as a fifth Global Commons.

#### **(h) What is meant by Most Favoured Nation (MFN) in international trade?**
*(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)*

**Answer:**
**Most-Favored-Nation (MFN)** is a fundamental principle of international trade and a cornerstone of the **World Trade Organization (WTO)**. It requires a country to grant any trade advantage, favor, or immunity that it gives to one country to all other WTO member countries immediately and unconditionally.

In simple terms, it is a principle of **non-discrimination between trading partners**. If a country lowers a tariff on a product for one trading partner, it must lower it for all other WTO members as well. Despite its name, MFN does not mean one country is the "most favored"; rather, it means it is treated equally with all other "most favored" nations.

#### **(i) What is the difference between an internal and external threat?**

**Answer:**
The difference between an internal and external threat lies in the origin of the threat to a state's security and stability.

*   **Internal Threat:** An **internal threat** originates from **within a state's own borders**. It involves challenges to the state's authority, stability, or integrity posed by its own citizens or domestic groups.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Insurgency or civil war:** Armed rebellion by a domestic group seeking to overthrow the government or secede.
        *   **Political instability and civil unrest:** Widespread protests, riots, and political violence.
        *   **Domestic terrorism.**
        *   **Ethnic or sectarian conflict** within the population.

*   **External Threat:** An **external threat** originates from **outside a state's borders**, posed by another state or a foreign non-state actor. It is a challenge to a state's sovereignty, territorial integrity, or national security from an external source.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Military invasion or aggression** by another country.
        *   **Cross-border terrorism** sponsored or supported by a foreign power.
        *   **Economic sanctions** or a trade war initiated by another state.
        *   **Espionage and cyberattacks** conducted by a foreign government.

In summary, the key distinction is the **source of the threat**: internal threats are domestic, while external threats are foreign.

#### **(j) What is meant by Non-State Actors in international politics? Give examples.**

**Answer:**
**Non-State Actors (NSAs)** are individuals or organizations that have significant political, economic, or social influence in international relations but are not affiliated with, directed by, or funded by any single government. They operate independently of state control and can act as powerful forces on the global stage.

The rise of non-state actors has challenged the traditional state-centric view of international politics, demonstrating that states are no longer the only significant actors.

Examples of Non-State Actors include:
1.  **Multinational Corporations (MNCs):** Large global companies like **Apple, Shell, or Google**, whose economic power and decisions can have a major impact on the economies and policies of many countries.
2.  **International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs):** Non-profit, advocacy, or humanitarian organizations that operate globally. Examples include the **International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)**, **Amnesty International**, and **Doctors Without Borders (MSF)**.
3.  **Terrorist and Insurgent Groups:** Armed groups like **ISIS** and **Al-Qaeda** that operate across borders and directly challenge state authority and international security.
4.  **Global Media Outlets:** Influential media organizations like **CNN, BBC, and Al Jazeera**, which can shape global public opinion and influence foreign policy debates.
5.  **Religious Organizations:** Transnational religious bodies like the **Catholic Church**.

#### **(k) What is meant by peacekeeping under the United Nations?**

**Answer:**
**United Nations Peacekeeping** is a unique and dynamic instrument developed by the UN to help countries torn by conflict create the conditions for lasting peace. It is one of the key tools used by the Security Council to maintain international peace and security.

UN Peacekeeping operations are deployed with the consent of the conflicting parties and are guided by three core principles:
1.  **Consent of the Parties:** Peacekeepers are deployed only with the agreement of the main parties to the conflict.
2.  **Impartiality:** Peacekeepers must be impartial in their dealings with the parties to the conflict, but not neutral in the face of violations of the mandate or international norms.
3.  **Non-use of Force except in Self-defense and Defense of the Mandate:** Peacekeepers are lightly armed and use force only as a last resort, primarily for self-defense or to defend their mandate, especially the protection of civilians.

The roles of UN Peacekeepers (often called "Blue Helmets") have evolved from simply monitoring ceasefires to undertaking complex, multidimensional tasks, including:
*   Protecting civilians.
*   Disarming former combatants.
*   Supporting elections.
*   Promoting human rights and the rule of law.

#### **(l) What is meant by power in international politics?**

**Answer:**
**Power** in international politics is the ability of an actor (usually a state) to influence the behavior of other actors to get the outcomes it wants. It is the central concept in the realist school of thought. Power is not an end in itself but a means to achieve national security and advance national interests.

Power can be understood in several ways:
1.  **Power as Capabilities (Hard Power):** This is the most traditional view, measuring power based on a state's tangible, material resources. These include:
    *   **Military Power:** Size and technological sophistication of the armed forces.
    *   **Economic Power:** GDP, industrial capacity, and control over resources.
    *   **Tangible Assets:** Population size, geographical location, and natural resources.

2.  **Power as Influence (Soft Power):** This refers to the ability to achieve goals through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion. It is derived from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political values (democracy, human rights), and foreign policies when they are seen as legitimate.

3.  **Smart Power:** This is the effective combination of hard and soft power resources into an integrated strategy. It involves knowing when to use military force, economic sanctions, diplomacy, or cultural appeal to achieve a desired outcome.

In essence, power is the currency of international politics, and the distribution of power among states is a key factor in determining the structure and stability of the international system.

### **Question 02: Answer any three of the following questions: (15x3=45)**

#### **(a) Discuss the potential impact of the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan on regional and international politics.**
*(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)*

**Answer:**

The withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan in August 2021, culminating in the swift collapse of the Afghan government and the return of the Taliban to power, has had a profound and destabilizing impact on regional and international politics.

**Impact on Regional Politics:**
1.  **Empowerment of Regional Terrorist Groups:** The Taliban's victory has emboldened other extremist and terrorist groups in the region, such as **Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)** and Al-Qaeda affiliates. Afghanistan has once again become a potential safe haven for these groups, posing a direct security threat to neighboring countries, especially **Pakistan**, **Iran**, and the Central Asian states.
2.  **Humanitarian and Refugee Crisis:** The collapse of the Afghan economy and the Taliban's repressive policies have created a severe humanitarian crisis, leading to mass internal displacement and a new wave of refugees seeking shelter in neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan and Iran, placing immense strain on their resources.
3.  **Shifting Regional Power Dynamics:** The withdrawal created a power vacuum. Regional powers like **Pakistan**, **Iran**, **China**, and **Russia** have increased their engagement with the Taliban government to protect their security interests and vie for influence.
4.  **Increase in Illicit Drug Trade:** With the collapse of the formal economy, Afghanistan's role as the world's largest producer of opium and a major source of methamphetamine has intensified, fueling transnational crime and instability across the region.

**Impact on International Politics:**
1.  **Damage to US Credibility:** The chaotic nature of the withdrawal dealt a significant blow to the credibility of the United States as a global partner. Allies and adversaries alike questioned US resolve and reliability.
2.  **End of the "Nation-Building" Era:** The failure in Afghanistan marked the symbolic end of the two-decade-long era of large-scale Western military interventions aimed at promoting democracy. It has led to a more cautious foreign policy approach in the West.
3.  **Shift in US Strategic Focus:** The withdrawal allowed the United States to pivot its strategic focus and resources away from counter-terrorism towards what it perceives as the primary long-term challenge: **great power competition with China and Russia**.
4.  **Human Rights Setback:** The return of the Taliban has resulted in a catastrophic rollback of human rights, particularly for women and girls, who have been systematically excluded from public life.

#### **(b) Experts have opined that there is no possibility of Bangladesh falling into a debt trap by joining the 'Belt and Road Initiative'. Discuss with comments.**
*(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)*

**Answer:**

The opinion that Bangladesh is unlikely to fall into a "debt trap" by joining China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a well-founded and credible assessment. I agree with this expert opinion based on Bangladesh's prudent debt management strategy and the diversified nature of its loan portfolio.

**Discussion and Comments:**

1.  **Diversified Debt Portfolio:** A key reason Bangladesh is not at high risk is that its foreign debt is not overwhelmingly concentrated with a single lender. Bangladesh's largest lenders are multilateral institutions like the **World Bank**, the **Asian Development Bank (ADB)**, and Japan (through **JICA**). These institutions provide loans on highly **concessional** (soft) terms. As of 2023, loans from China constituted a relatively small portion (around 6-8%) of Bangladesh's total external debt stock, which mitigates the risk of dependence on any single creditor.

2.  **Prudent Government Policy and Project Selection:** Unlike countries that took on high-interest commercial loans for projects with questionable economic viability, Bangladesh has generally been more cautious. The government prioritizes **concessional financing** and conducts thorough feasibility studies to ensure that the projects it undertakes, such as the Padma Bridge Rail Link or the Karnaphuli Tunnel, will generate sufficient economic returns to service the debt.

3.  **Strong and Stable Macroeconomic Management:** Bangladesh has maintained a strong track record of macroeconomic stability, with consistent GDP growth and a healthy debt-to-GDP ratio. The country's debt-to-GDP ratio remains well below the international cautionary threshold of 55-60%, indicating that its overall debt level is sustainable.

4.  **Learning from Others' Mistakes:** Bangladeshi policymakers are acutely aware of the "debt-trap diplomacy" narrative and the cautionary tale of Sri Lanka. This has reinforced a conservative approach to borrowing, ensuring that projects are selected based on national priority and economic feasibility rather than geopolitical alignment alone.

**Conclusion:**
While any large-scale borrowing carries risks, the structure of Bangladesh's external debt, its policy of prioritizing concessional loans, and its strong macroeconomic fundamentals provide a solid defense against a debt trap. The assertion by experts that Bangladesh is not on a path to a debt crisis due to its participation in the BRI is, therefore, a realistic and well-supported analysis.

#### **(d) What is economic diplomacy? Discuss the importance of economic diplomacy in the foreign policy of Bangladesh. What steps can Bangladesh take to strengthen its economic diplomacy?**

**Answer:**

**What is Economic Diplomacy?**
**Economic diplomacy** is the use of a state's full economic toolkit to advance its foreign policy objectives and national interests. It involves using economic instruments such as trade, investment, development aid, and financial policy to achieve geopolitical goals. Conversely, it also involves using diplomatic tools (negotiations, treaties, and international relations) to achieve national economic goals. In the modern globalized world, it has become a central component of foreign policy for all nations.

**Importance of Economic Diplomacy for Bangladesh:**
For Bangladesh, a country whose development journey is heavily reliant on its integration with the global economy, economic diplomacy is not just important—it is **essential for national survival and prosperity**.
1.  **Driving Export Growth:** The RMG sector, which accounts for over 80% of Bangladesh's exports, is heavily dependent on preferential market access to the EU and USA. Economic diplomacy is crucial for negotiating favorable trade terms (like GSP+), maintaining these relationships, and exploring new markets.
2.  **Attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):** To achieve the goals of Vision 2041, Bangladesh needs massive investment in infrastructure and industry. Economic diplomacy, through its embassies and investment promotion agencies (like BIDA), plays a key role in attracting FDI by showcasing the country's potential and improving its business climate.
3.  **Securing Development Finance:** Bangladesh's mega-projects are often financed through loans and aid from development partners like the World Bank, ADB, JICA, and China. Skillful economic diplomacy is required to negotiate these loans on favorable terms.
4.  **Protecting Migrant Workers:** The well-being of millions of Bangladeshi expatriates and the smooth flow of their remittances (a pillar of the economy) depend on strong diplomatic relations with host countries in the Middle East and elsewhere.

**Steps to Strengthen Economic Diplomacy:**
1.  **Capacity Building in Foreign Missions:** Train diplomats specifically in trade negotiation, investment promotion, and commercial law. Appoint specialized "commercial counselors" in key embassies.
2.  **Proactive Market Research and Branding:** Foreign missions must proactively identify new export markets and opportunities for Bangladeshi products beyond RMG. They should also lead "Brand Bangladesh" campaigns to improve the country's image as an investment destination.
3.  **Streamlining Inter-Ministerial Coordination:** Ensure seamless coordination between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other key economic ministries like Commerce, Finance, and the Prime Minister's Office to present a unified and effective front in international negotiations.
4.  **Leveraging the Diaspora:** Actively engage the successful non-resident Bangladeshi (NRB) community as "goodwill ambassadors" to promote investment and technology transfer.

### **Question 03**

#### **Prepare a policy brief for the Government of Bangladesh on the Rohingya issue.**
*(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)*

**Answer:**

### **Policy Brief for the Government of Bangladesh**

**To:** The Honourable Foreign Minister, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh
**From:** [Your Title/Department]
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Subject:** **A Proactive and Comprehensive Strategy for the Sustainable Resolution of the Rohingya Crisis**

**1. Introduction and Core Objective:**

For over five years, Bangladesh has borne an immense humanitarian burden by hosting over 1.1 million Rohingya refugees. Despite our government's good-faith efforts, the lack of political will from Myanmar has created a complete stalemate in the repatriation process. This protracted crisis now poses significant security, economic, and environmental threats to Bangladesh. The core objective of our policy must be to **shift the international focus from merely managing the crisis in Bangladesh to compelling concrete action to resolve its root causes in Myanmar.**

**2. Strategic Policy Pillars:**

**Pillar I: Sustained and Multifaceted Diplomatic Pressure**
*   **Bilateral Engagement:** While maintaining the bilateral channel with Myanmar's authorities, we must acknowledge its current limitations and use it primarily to maintain a formal line of communication.
*   **Intensify Regional Diplomacy:** Actively lobby key **ASEAN** nations (especially Indonesia and Malaysia) and regional powers (**India and China**) to use their leverage on Myanmar to create conditions conducive to repatriation. Frame the crisis not as a Bangladesh-Myanmar issue, but as a threat to regional stability.
*   **Mobilize the International Community:** Continue to spearhead resolutions at the **UN General Assembly** and the **UN Human Rights Council**. Our key demand should be a binding **UNSC resolution** that sets a clear timeline for repatriation and establishes internationally monitored "safe zones" in Rakhine State.

**Pillar II: Emphasis on Accountability and Justice**
*   **Support International Justice Mechanisms:** Actively support the ongoing cases at the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** (filed by The Gambia) and the investigation by the **International Criminal Court (ICC)**. Justice for the genocide is not just a moral imperative but a prerequisite for a sustainable solution, as it can deter future atrocities and create pressure on the junta.
*   **Call for Targeted Sanctions:** Advocate for stronger, coordinated international sanctions against the Myanmar military junta and their economic interests to limit their ability to wage war against their own people.

**Pillar III: Management of the Camps and Mitigation of Risks**
*   **Enhanced Security:** Increase security within the camps to dismantle the criminal networks involved in drug trafficking, human trafficking, and other illicit activities that threaten both the Rohingya and the host community.
*   **Education and Skills Development:** Implement a comprehensive education program using the Myanmar curriculum and provide vocational skills training. This prepares the Rohingya for reintegration, prevents a "lost generation," and reduces the risk of radicalization.

**3. Conclusion and Recommendation:**

Bangladesh has fulfilled its humanitarian duty. The international community must now fulfill its responsibility. Our policy should be clear: the only durable solution is the **safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable repatriation** of the Rohingya to their homeland in Myanmar. This requires a fundamental shift in the international approach—from containment of the crisis in Bangladesh to a resolution of the conflict in Myanmar. Our diplomacy must be relentless in pursuit of this goal.
