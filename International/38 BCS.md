Of course. Here are the detailed answers for all the short-note questions from Section 1 of the provided exam paper.

### **01. Brief Discussion on any ten of the following topics (4x10 = 40)**

**(a) What is meant by a multinational state?**

A multinational state is a sovereign state that is comprised of two or more distinct nations or ethnic groups, each with its own collective identity, culture, and often language. Unlike a nation-state, where a single national group forms the majority and defines the state's identity, a multinational state's identity is based on a shared political community rather than a single ethnicity.

Managing this diversity is the central challenge for such states. They must foster a sense of shared citizenship and political loyalty that transcends ethnic or national lines to prevent internal conflict or secessionist movements.

**Examples:**
*   **India:** With hundreds of linguistic and ethnic groups.
*   **Canada:** With its distinct English-speaking and French-speaking (Québécois) national communities.
*   **The United Kingdom:** Comprising England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

**(b) What are the main components of human security?**

Human security is a people-centric approach to security that shifts the focus from the security of the state (from external military threats) to the security of the individual (from a wide range of threats to their survival, livelihood, and dignity). First articulated in the 1994 UNDP Human Development Report, it has seven main components:

1.  **Economic Security:** Freedom from poverty; assured basic income.
2.  **Food Security:** Physical and economic access to basic food.
3.  **Health Security:** Access to healthcare and protection from diseases.
4.  **Environmental Security:** Protection from natural disasters, environmental degradation, and pollution.
5.  **Personal Security:** Protection from physical violence, whether from the state, other states, or individuals (e.g., crime, domestic violence).
6.  **Community Security:** Protection of cultural identity and peaceful relationships within communities.
7.  **Political Security:** Protection of basic human rights and freedom from political repression.

---

**(c) What is the main argument of Democratic Peace Theory?**

The main argument of the Democratic Peace Theory is the empirical observation that **liberal democracies do not go to war with one another**. While democracies may engage in wars with non-democratic states, there are virtually no historical cases of established democracies fighting wars against each other.

There are two main explanations for this phenomenon:
1.  **Normative/Cultural Explanation:** Democracies share common norms of peaceful conflict resolution, compromise, and mutual respect. They tend to view other democracies as legitimate and non-threatening, preferring to resolve disputes through diplomacy and negotiation.
2.  **Structural/Institutional Explanation:** The institutional structures of democracies—such as checks and balances, separation of powers, and the need for public debate and voter accountability—make it difficult for leaders to rush into war without broad support.

---

**(d) What is meant by crimes against humanity? Give an example.**

Crimes against humanity are certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a **widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population**, with knowledge of the attack. As defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, these crimes are particularly odious offenses because they constitute a serious attack on human dignity or a grave humiliation of human beings.

Key characteristics are that they are not random or isolated acts and are targeted at civilians.

**Examples of acts that can constitute crimes against humanity include:**
*   Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer of population.
*   Torture, rape, sexual slavery, and other forms of sexual violence.
*   Persecution against any identifiable group on political, racial, national, ethnic, or religious grounds.
*   The crime of apartheid.

A historical example is the systematic persecution and murder of Jews and other minorities by the Nazi regime during the Holocaust.

---

**(e) What is the difference between 'territory' and 'territorial integrity'?**

While related, 'territory' and 'territorial integrity' refer to different concepts.

*   **Territory:** This is a **noun** that refers to one of the four essential elements of a state. It is the physical, geographical area (including land, water, and airspace) over which a state exercises its sovereignty. It is the tangible, physical space a state occupies.

*   **Territorial Integrity:** This is a **principle** of international law. Enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, it is the right of a sovereign state to have its borders respected and to be free from aggression, invasion, or violation by other states. It is the legal norm that protects a state's territory from external threats.

**In summary:** Territory is the *physical space* a state controls. Territorial integrity is the *legal principle* that protects that space from outside violation.

---

**(f) Briefly discuss the characteristics of a developing country.**

Developing countries are a diverse group of nations characterized by their ongoing efforts to achieve higher levels of economic and social progress. While they vary greatly, they generally share several common characteristics:

1.  **Low Per Capita Income:** They typically have a low Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita compared to developed nations.
2.  **Dependence on Agriculture:** Their economies are often heavily reliant on agriculture and the export of primary commodities, making them vulnerable to price fluctuations.
3.  **Low Levels of Industrialization:** They have a less developed industrial sector and lower levels of technological adoption.
4.  **High Rates of Poverty and Inequality:** They often face significant challenges with widespread poverty and a high degree of income inequality.
5.  **Poor Human Development Indicators:** They tend to have lower levels of education and literacy, higher rates of infant mortality, and lower life expectancy.
6.  **High Population Growth:** Many developing countries experience rapid population growth, which can put a strain on resources and social services.

---

**(g) What is the concept of Global Commons?**

The Global Commons refers to resource domains or areas that lie outside the political jurisdiction of any single state and are, in principle, shared by all of humanity. These resources are guided by the principle of common heritage of mankind.

There are four universally recognized Global Commons:
1.  **The High Seas:** Areas of the ocean beyond national jurisdiction.
2.  **The Atmosphere:** The Earth's shared air and climate system.
3.  **Antarctica:** The continent governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, which dedicates it to peace and science.
4.  **Outer Space:** The expanse that exists beyond Earth and its atmosphere.

The primary challenge associated with the Global Commons is the "Tragedy of the Commons"—the difficulty of managing these shared resources to prevent their overuse and degradation in the absence of a central governing authority.

---

**(h) What is meant by Most Favoured Nation (MFN) in international trade?**

Most Favoured Nation (MFN) is a fundamental principle of non-discrimination in international trade and a cornerstone of the World Trade Organization (WTO) system. It requires a country to grant any trade advantage, privilege, or immunity it gives to one WTO member country to **all other WTO members** immediately and unconditionally.

Contrary to what the name suggests, MFN does not mean giving one country special treatment. Instead, it ensures **equal treatment** for all trading partners. For example, if a country lowers its import tariff on a product from one country, it must apply the same lower tariff to that product from all other WTO members. This promotes fair competition and a more liberal global trading system.

---

**(i) What is the difference between internal and external threats?**

The difference between internal and external threats lies in their origin.

*   **Internal Threats:** These are threats to a state's security, stability, and sovereignty that originate *within* its own borders. They challenge the government's authority and the unity of the state itself.
    *   **Examples:** Civil war, ethnic conflict, secessionist movements, widespread political unrest, and terrorism carried out by domestic groups.

*   **External Threats:** These are threats that originate from *outside* a state's borders, posed by other states or international actors. They challenge a state's territorial integrity and political independence.
    *   **Examples:** Military invasion by another country, cross-border terrorism, economic sanctions, cyber-attacks from foreign sources, and espionage.

---

**(j) What is meant by Non-State Actors in international politics? Write with examples.**

Non-State Actors (NSAs) are individuals or organizations that have significant political influence, operate across national borders, but are not affiliated with or part of any state government. They have grown increasingly important in shaping international politics.

They can be categorized into several types, with examples:
*   **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs):** Non-profit, citizen-based groups that advocate for specific causes. **Examples:** The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders.
*   **Multinational Corporations (MNCs):** Large for-profit companies that operate in multiple countries and have significant economic power. **Examples:** Google, Shell, Toyota.
*   **Violent Non-State Actors:** Armed groups that challenge state authority. **Examples:** Terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and rebel or insurgent groups.
*   **International Governmental Organizations (IGOs):** While created by states, they function as independent actors. **Example:** The United Nations (UN).

---

**(k) What is meant by peacekeeping under the United Nations?**

UN Peacekeeping is a unique and dynamic instrument deployed by the United Nations to help countries torn by conflict create conditions for lasting peace. It involves the deployment of military, police, and civilian personnel from member states, who serve under the UN flag.

UN peacekeeping operations are guided by three core principles:
1.  **Consent of the parties:** Peacekeepers are deployed only with the consent of the main parties to the conflict.
2.  **Impartiality:** Peacekeepers must remain impartial in their dealings with the parties to the conflict.
3.  **Non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate:** Force is used only as a last resort.

Their roles range from monitoring ceasefires and protecting civilians to assisting in disarmament and supporting democratic elections.

---

**(l) What is meant by power in international politics?**

In international politics, power is the central concept. It is most simply defined as the ability of an actor (A) to influence the behavior of another actor (B) to get them to do something they would not otherwise have done. It is the currency through which states pursue their national interests.

Power is multi-dimensional and can be categorized into:
*   **Hard Power:** The ability to coerce or command, primarily through military and economic might. **Examples:** Military threats, economic sanctions, trade wars.
*   **Soft Power:** The ability to attract and persuade rather than coerce. It arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political values (like democracy), and foreign policies.
*   **Smart Power:** The effective and intelligent combination of both hard and soft power strategies to achieve foreign policy goals.

### **2. Answer any three of the following questions (15x3=45)**

**(a) (i) Identify the important issues in Bangladesh-Myanmar bilateral relations. (ii) Do you consider the Rohingya issue a 'national security crisis' or a 'humanitarian crisis'? Discuss the strategies and steps to address this crisis from your perspective.**

**(i) Important Issues in Bangladesh-Myanmar Bilateral Relations (5 marks)**

The relationship between Bangladesh and Myanmar is complex and dominated by several critical and often contentious issues:

1.  **The Rohingya Refugee Crisis:** This is the single most dominant and overwhelming issue. The repeated influx of persecuted Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar's Rakhine State into Bangladesh, culminating in the massive exodus of over 750,000 in 2017, has placed an immense economic, social, and environmental burden on Bangladesh.
2.  **Repatriation Stalemate:** Despite signing bilateral agreements, Myanmar has failed to create the necessary conditions for the safe, dignified, and sustainable repatriation of the Rohingya, leading to a prolonged stalemate.
3.  **Border Security and Transnational Crime:** The shared border is porous and a hub for illicit activities, including the smuggling of narcotics (especially Yaba), human trafficking, and occasional skirmishes between border forces.
4.  **Maritime Boundary and Resources:** While the maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal was successfully demarcated through international arbitration in 2012, cooperation on the joint management of shared fish stocks and hydrocarbon resources remains an underdeveloped area.
5.  **Trade and Connectivity:** There is significant untapped potential for enhancing bilateral trade and establishing better road and waterway connectivity, which is often hindered by political instability and a lack of trust.

**(ii) Rohingya Issue: National Security or Humanitarian Crisis? (10 marks)**

The Rohingya issue is not one or the other; it is **both a profound humanitarian crisis and a growing national security crisis for Bangladesh**. The two dimensions are deeply intertwined.

*   **As a Humanitarian Crisis:** The issue is fundamentally a humanitarian catastrophe. It involves a population that has faced systematic persecution, ethnic cleansing, and potential genocide, forcing them to flee for their lives. Their immediate needs for food, shelter, healthcare, and basic dignity are a matter of human conscience and international humanitarian law.

*   **As a National Security Crisis for Bangladesh:** The prolonged presence of over a million refugees has metastasized into a multi-faceted national security threat:
    1.  **Socio-Economic Strain:** The massive refugee population puts immense pressure on land, resources, and the local economy in Cox's Bazar, creating social tension and conflict with the host community.
    2.  **Internal Security Risks:** The densely populated camps are becoming breeding grounds for crime, including drug trafficking, human smuggling, and violence between armed factions. There is a serious risk of radicalization and recruitment by extremist groups.
    3.  **Environmental Degradation:** The clearing of vast forest areas for camps has led to severe environmental damage, increasing the risk of landslides and ecological imbalance.
    4.  **Regional Instability:** The unresolved crisis is a source of potential instability for the entire region, with risks of cross-border conflict and destabilizing population movements.

**Strategies and Steps to Address the Crisis:**

A comprehensive strategy must address both the humanitarian and security dimensions simultaneously.

1.  **Intensify Global Diplomatic Pressure:** Bangladesh cannot solve this alone. The core strategy must be to **escalate diplomatic pressure on Myanmar**. This includes:
    *   **Building a Stronger Coalition:** Moving beyond bilateral talks and actively building a stronger coalition of international partners (including ASEAN, the EU, the US, and key OIC countries) to apply unified pressure on the Myanmar regime.
    *   **Utilizing International Justice Mechanisms:** Actively supporting and providing evidence for the ongoing cases at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Accountability for the atrocities is a prerequisite for a just solution.

2.  **Engaging Key Regional Powers:** Special diplomatic focus must be placed on **China and India**, the two regional powers with the most leverage over Myanmar. Bangladesh must persistently work to convince them that a stable, resolved Rakhine State is in their own strategic and economic interest.

3.  **Enhanced Camp Management and Security:** While pursuing repatriation, Bangladesh must manage the internal security threat. This involves strengthening law enforcement presence in the camps, cracking down on criminal networks, and implementing programs (education, skills training) to prevent radicalization and give the refugee population a sense of purpose.

4.  **Condition-Based Repatriation:** Bangladesh must remain firm on its stance that repatriation must be **safe, dignified, voluntary, and sustainable**. This requires verifiable actions from Myanmar, including granting citizenship rights to the Rohingya, ensuring their security in Rakhine, and allowing international monitoring bodies access.

In essence, the strategy must be a dual one: compassionately manage the humanitarian needs of the refugees within our borders while relentlessly pursuing a robust, multilateral diplomatic and legal campaign to compel Myanmar to create the conditions for their just and permanent return.

**(c) Identify the relationship between migration and development. How do you evaluate this relationship in the contemporary world order? Explain in detail.**

**The Relationship Between Migration and Development**

Migration and development share a complex, dynamic, and mutually influential relationship. This relationship is not linear; migration can be both a cause and a consequence of development, and its effects can be positive, negative, or mixed for both the countries of origin and destination.

1.  **Migration as a Driver of Development (Positive Linkages):**
    *   **Remittances:** This is the most significant positive link. Money sent home by migrant workers is a vital source of foreign exchange for many developing countries. These financial flows improve household incomes, fund education and healthcare, stimulate local economies, and are often more stable than foreign direct investment (FDI) or official development aid (ODA).
    *   **Human Capital and "Brain Gain":** While "brain drain" is a risk, migration can also lead to "brain gain" or "brain circulation." Migrants acquire new skills, knowledge, and experience abroad, which they can transfer back to their home countries by returning, investing, or establishing transnational networks.
    *   **Social Remittances:** Migrants also transmit new ideas, social norms, and democratic values back to their communities, which can contribute to social and political development.

2.  **Migration as a Consequence of a Lack of Development:**
    *   **"Push" Factors:** A lack of development often drives migration. People migrate due to poverty, lack of economic opportunities, political instability, conflict, and poor governance. In this sense, migration is often a symptom of underdevelopment.

3.  **Migration as a Hindrance to Development (Negative Linkages):**
    *   **"Brain Drain":** The emigration of highly skilled professionals—doctors, engineers, scientists—can cripple essential public services and hamper the long-term development capacity of countries of origin.
    *   **Social Costs:** The separation of families and the social disruption caused by large-scale emigration can have significant negative consequences for communities.

**Evaluation in the Contemporary World Order**

In the contemporary world order, the migration-development nexus has become even more critical and complex.

*   **Globalization's Role:** Globalization has intensified this relationship. While it has facilitated the easier movement of capital and goods, the movement of labor, especially low-skilled labor, remains highly restricted. This creates a fundamental tension in the global system.
*   **The "Development" Mantra in Migration Policy:** Developed countries increasingly frame their migration policies through a "development" lens, but this is often self-serving. They promote policies that encourage the circulation of high-skilled migrants they need ("brain gain" for them) while heavily restricting low-skilled migration. Foreign aid is often tied to a country's cooperation in controlling "irregular" migration, turning development assistance into a tool for migration management.
*   **Growing Anti-Immigrant Sentiment:** In many developed nations, a rise in nationalism and populism has led to growing anti-immigrant sentiment. This has resulted in more restrictive immigration policies, increased securitization of borders, and a political climate that often ignores the immense positive contributions of migrants to the development of both their host and home countries.
*   **Forced Migration:** The contemporary world is witnessing unprecedented levels of forced migration due to conflict and climate change. For these populations, migration is not a choice for development but a desperate act of survival, posing immense challenges to the global development and humanitarian systems.

In conclusion, the relationship between migration and development is undeniable. However, in the current global order, the potential for migration to be a powerful engine for development is being undermined by restrictive, often hypocritical policies in the developed world and the growing scale of forced displacement. A truly fair and effective global migration governance system would be one that recognizes migration as a fundamental aspect of the human story and works to maximize its development benefits for all, not just a select few.

### **3. As a result of the settlement of the maritime boundary dispute with Myanmar and India, a vast area in the Bay of Bengal has come under the sovereignty of Bangladesh. Prepare a Policy Brief for the Government of Bangladesh to ensure peace and security in this area.**

**Policy Brief for the Government of Bangladesh**

**TO:** National Security Council, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh
**FROM:** Ministry of Foreign Affairs
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT: A Comprehensive Strategy for Peace, Security, and Prosperity in the Bay of Bengal**

**1. Executive Summary:**
Following the landmark resolutions of maritime boundary disputes with Myanmar (2012) and India (2014), Bangladesh has gained sovereign rights over a vast sea area of 118,813 square kilometers in the Bay of Bengal. This maritime domain is a frontier of immense economic opportunity and a zone of increasing strategic importance. To secure our national interests, Bangladesh must adopt a proactive, integrated, and multi-dimensional **"Blue Economy"** security strategy. This brief outlines the key policy actions required to ensure peace and security in our maritime territory, transforming it into a hub of sustainable prosperity.

**2. Key Challenges and Threats:**
Our maritime domain faces a complex set of traditional and non-traditional security threats:
*   **Non-Traditional Threats:** Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing by foreign trawlers, piracy and armed robbery at sea, smuggling of narcotics and arms, human trafficking, and marine pollution.
*   **Traditional Threats:** The Bay of Bengal is an area of growing geopolitical competition between major powers. While our relations with India and Myanmar are stable, any regional instability could threaten our maritime security.
*   **Capacity Gaps:** Our maritime law enforcement agencies currently lack the full spectrum of capabilities for effective 24/7 surveillance and interdiction across our entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

**3. Policy Recommendations: The Three-Pillar Strategy**

To ensure peace and security, the government should adopt a three-pillar strategy focusing on **(I) Capability Enhancement, (II) Inter-Agency Coordination, and (III) Diplomatic Engagement.**

**Pillar I: Enhance Maritime Domain Awareness and Enforcement Capability**
The foundational step is to see and control our waters.
*   **Invest in a National Maritime Surveillance System:** Procure and integrate long-range patrol aircraft, coastal radar systems, and satellite monitoring technology to create a comprehensive, real-time picture of our EEZ.
*   **Modernize the Bangladesh Navy and Coast Guard:** Expedite the procurement of modern offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), fast-attack craft, and helicopters. Focus on developing capabilities for sustained, long-duration patrols in deep-sea areas.
*   **Establish a National Maritime Research Center:** Invest in marine science and oceanography to understand and sustainably manage our marine resources, which is a key component of long-term security.

**Pillar II: Strengthen National Inter-Agency Coordination**
Security at sea requires a unified national effort, not a fragmented one.
*   **Establish a National Maritime Security Council (NMSC):** Create a high-level coordination body, chaired by the Prime Minister’s Office, bringing together the Navy, Coast Guard, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Shipping, Department of Fisheries, and Department of Environment.
*   **Develop a Joint Maritime Operations Center (JMOC):** This center would serve as the nerve center for fusing intelligence, coordinating patrols, and directing joint operations among all maritime law enforcement agencies.
*   **Harmonize Legal Frameworks:** Review and update national maritime laws to ensure they provide a robust legal basis for combating modern maritime crimes like IUU fishing and marine pollution.

**Pillar III: Proactive Maritime Diplomacy**
Our security at sea is intrinsically linked to the stability of the region.
*   **Deepen Cooperation with India and Myanmar:** Build on our positive relationships to establish joint patrols, real-time information sharing mechanisms, and coordinated operations to combat transnational maritime crime.
*   **Lead in Regional Forums:** Actively use platforms like BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to promote a rules-based maritime order, freedom of navigation, and a regional code of conduct for the Bay of Bengal.
*   **Engage with Extra-Regional Powers:** Pursue "security partnerships" with key international actors (e.g., Japan, USA, EU) to gain access to technology, training, and capacity-building support for our maritime security forces.

**4. Conclusion:**
Securing our maritime domain in the Bay of Bengal is not just a defense issue; it is a national economic and strategic imperative. By investing in our capabilities, unifying our national efforts, and pursuing proactive diplomacy, Bangladesh can protect its sovereign rights, unlock the immense potential of its Blue Economy, and establish itself as a responsible and influential maritime nation ensuring peace and stability in the region.
