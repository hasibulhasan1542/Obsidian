Of course. Here are the answers to the questions from the "International Affairs" paper.

***

### **Question 1: Answer the following questions (4x10=40)**

#### **(a) What are the Geneva Conventions? Why are they important?**

**Answer:**

The **Geneva Conventions** are a series of four international treaties, established in 1949, that set the legal standards for humanitarian treatment in times of armed conflict. They are a core component of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), also known as the laws of war.

*   **First Convention:** Protects wounded and sick soldiers on land.
*   **Second Convention:** Protects wounded, sick, and shipwrecked military personnel at sea.
*   **Third Convention:** Applies to prisoners of war (POWs), outlining their rights and acceptable conditions of captivity.
*   **Fourth Convention:** Affords protection to civilians, including those in occupied territories.

**Importance:**
The Geneva Conventions are critically important for several reasons:
1.  **Upholding Human Dignity:** They establish a minimum standard of humane conduct, even in the midst of war, asserting that all individuals, including enemies, have a right to be treated with dignity.
2.  **Protecting Non-Combatants:** Their primary goal is to protect those who are not, or are no longer, participating in hostilities, such as civilians, medical personnel, the wounded, and prisoners of war.
3.  **Defining War Crimes:** The conventions explicitly forbid actions like torture, summary execution, and taking hostages, and define these as "grave breaches" or war crimes. This provides a legal basis for holding individuals accountable.
4.  **Universal Acceptance:** They have been ratified by 196 countries, making them universally applicable laws and a cornerstone of the international legal order.

#### **(b) What is the role of 'Five Eyes' in international politics?**

**Answer:**

The **Five Eyes (FVEY)** is a signals intelligence (SIGINT) alliance comprising five English-speaking countries: the<font color="#ffff00"> **United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand**</font>. Its role in international politics is multifaceted and highly influential:

1.  **Intelligence Sharing and Collection:** Its core function is the large-scale collection and sharing of intelligence, particularly intercepted communications. This creates a powerful, integrated intelligence network that gives member states a significant strategic advantage over adversaries.
2.  **Counter-Terrorism and Security:** Post-9/11, the alliance became a crucial tool for global counter-terrorism efforts, sharing information to track terrorist networks, thwart plots, and enhance domestic security.
3.  **Geopolitical Influence:** The intelligence gathered by the Five Eyes informs the foreign policy, military, and diplomatic strategies of its members. It plays a key role in shaping their collective stance on geopolitical rivals like China and Russia.
4.  **Global Surveillance and Controversy:** As revealed by Edward Snowden, the alliance operates vast global surveillance programs. This role is highly controversial, raising major questions about privacy for citizens worldwide, the sovereignty of non-member nations, and the extent of state surveillance powers.

#### **(c) Explain the difference between concessional and non-concessional loans with examples.**

**Answer:**

The key difference between concessional and non-concessional loans lies in their financial terms and purpose, distinguishing development aid from commercial financing.

| Basis of Difference | Concessional Loan ("Soft Loan")                                                                                                                                                   | Non-Concessional Loan ("Hard Loan")                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | To provide development assistance to low-income countries without creating an unsustainable debt burden. It is considered official development aid (ODA).                         | To provide financing on a commercial basis to middle-income or creditworthy countries that can afford to borrow at market rates. It is not considered aid.                                      |
| **Financial Terms** | Highly favorable to the borrower. Characterized by very low or zero interest rates, long grace periods (before repayment begins), and long repayment periods (e.g., 30-40 years). | Based on market rates. Interest rates are variable or fixed at a commercial level, and repayment periods are shorter.                                                                           |
| **Source**          | Typically provided by multilateral development banks' "soft loan" windows or by individual countries as foreign aid.                                                              | Provided by commercial banks, private lenders, or the standard lending arms of multilateral institutions.                                                                                       |
| **Example**         | A loan from the **World Bank's International Development Association (IDA)** to a least developed country for a health project.                                                   | A loan from a commercial bank like Citibank to a corporation, or from the **World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)** to a middle-income country like Brazil. |

#### **(d) Explain the main causes of the 'Arab Spring'.**

**Answer:**

The "Arab Spring" was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. Its main causes were a combination of long-term grievances and a short-term trigger:

1.  **Authoritarian Rule and Political Repression:** Decades of rule by autocratic leaders, combined with a lack of political freedom, suppression of dissent, and rampant human rights abuses, created deep-seated frustration among the populace.
2.  **Economic Grievances:** Widespread unemployment (especially among the youth), high poverty rates, rising food prices, and vast income inequality fueled public anger.
3.  **Endemic Corruption:** Systemic corruption within governments meant that state wealth and resources benefited a small ruling elite, while the general population was left behind.
4.  **Demographic Factors:** The region had a significant "youth bulge"â€”a large population of young, educated, and tech-savvy individuals with limited opportunities and high aspirations for a better future.
5.  **The Role of Technology:** Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, along with mobile phones, enabled activists to organize protests, disseminate information, and bypass state-controlled media, accelerating the spread of the uprisings.
6.  **The Trigger:** The self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor, in December 2010 served as the powerful catalyst that ignited the protests, first in Tunisia and then across the region.

#### **(e) <font color="#ffff00">What is the difference between G-20 and BRICS</font>?**

**Answer:**

While both are major non-Western-centric groupings of states, the G-20 and BRICS differ significantly in their composition, scope, and primary purpose.

| Basis of Difference      | G-20 (Group of Twenty)                                                                                                                                                                            | BRICS                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Composition & Nature** | A broad forum comprising 19 of the world's largest economies plus the European Union and the African Union. It includes both developed and emerging economies.                                    | A more exclusive bloc comprising five major emerging economies: **B**razil, **R**ussia, **I**ndia, **C**hina, and **S**outh Africa.

#### **(f) Analyze the challenges and prospects for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region.**

**Answer:**

The Indo-Pacific region is a major global hub for trade and geopolitics, but it faces significant challenges to peace and security, alongside prospects for cooperation.

**Challenges:**
1.  **Sino-American Rivalry:** The primary challenge is the escalating strategic competition between the United States and China, which plays out through military posturing, economic competition, and a struggle for influence over regional states.
2.  **Territorial Disputes:** Multiple unresolved disputes threaten stability, including the South China Sea conflict (involving China and several ASEAN nations), the East China Sea dispute (between China and Japan), and the China-India border standoff.
3.  **North Korea's Nuclear Program:** North Korea's ongoing development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles remains a major source of tension and a significant proliferation risk.
4.  **Non-Traditional Threats:** The region is vulnerable to terrorism, piracy (especially in the Malacca Strait), climate change-induced disasters, and illegal fishing.

**Prospects:**
1.  **Regional Architecture:** Institutions like ASEAN and the East Asia Summit provide platforms for dialogue and confidence-building, aiming to manage conflicts peacefully.
2.  **Minilateral Cooperation:** The rise of security groupings like the **Quad** (US, Japan, Australia, India) and **AUKUS** (Australia, UK, US) aims to create a balance of power and deter aggression, promoting a "free and open Indo-Pacific."
3.  **Economic Interdependence:** The deep economic ties among most regional actors create a strong incentive to avoid conflict and maintain stability for trade and investment to flourish.

---
#### **(g) Discuss the impact of climate change on international security.**

**Answer:**

Climate change is increasingly recognized as a "threat multiplier" that exacerbates existing risks and creates new challenges to international security.

1.  **Resource Scarcity and Conflict:** Climate change leads to water shortages (desertification), food insecurity (crop failure), and competition over resources like arable land and fishing stocks. This can heighten tensions within and between states, potentially leading to conflict.
2.  **Climate-Induced Migration:** Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and drought force mass displacement of people. This can create large-scale refugee crises, placing immense pressure on neighboring states and potentially destabilizing entire regions.
3.  **Threats to State Stability:** The economic and social costs of climate change can overwhelm governments, particularly in fragile states. This can lead to political instability, civil unrest, and the collapse of state institutions, creating ungoverned spaces where terrorist or criminal groups can thrive.
4.  **Geopolitical Competition in the Arctic:** The melting of Arctic sea ice is opening up new shipping lanes and access to previously inaccessible natural resources (oil, gas). This has triggered geopolitical competition among Arctic and non-Arctic states over sovereignty, control, and military presence in the region.

---
#### **(h) What are the main challenges to sovereignty for developing countries in the current world order?**

**Answer:**

In the current globalized world order, the traditional concept of state sovereignty faces significant challenges, especially for developing countries.

1.  **Economic Interdependence and Conditionality:** Developing nations are often dependent on foreign aid, loans, and investment. Institutions like the **IMF** and **World Bank**, as well as powerful states, often attach policy conditions (e.g., structural adjustment programs) to this financial assistance, which can limit the receiving state's ability to set its own economic policy.
2.  **Interventionism and R2P:** The norm of the "Responsibility to Protect" (R2P) allows for international intervention in a state that is failing to protect its population from mass atrocities. While well-intentioned, this can be seen by developing countries as a pretext for powerful states to violate their sovereignty.
3.  **Power of Multinational Corporations (MNCs):** Large MNCs wield immense economic power, sometimes exceeding that of smaller developing states. They can influence domestic policy, exploit resources, and evade taxes, thereby challenging the state's economic sovereignty.
4.  **Globalization and Transnational Threats:** Global issues like climate change, pandemics, cybercrime, and international terrorism do not respect national borders. Addressing them requires international cooperation and ceding some degree of national control, which can be seen as an erosion of sovereignty.

#### **(i) Explain how Cyber Warfare and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can influence international relations.**

**Answer:**

Cyber warfare and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are transforming the landscape of international relations, introducing new domains of conflict and cooperation.

**Cyber Warfare:**
Cyber warfare involves state-sponsored attacks on another nation's computer systems and networks. Its influence includes:
*   **A New Domain of Conflict:** It adds a "fifth domain" of warfare (after land, sea, air, and space), allowing for conflict below the threshold of traditional military engagement.
*   **Asymmetric Threats:** It enables weaker states or non-state actors to challenge more powerful nations by targeting critical infrastructure (power grids, financial systems) or conducting espionage and disinformation campaigns.
*   **Erosion of Deterrence:** The difficulty of attributing cyberattacks makes traditional deterrence and retaliation complex, leading to a state of constant, low-level conflict.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
AI's influence on international relations is rapidly growing:
*   **Autonomous Weapons:** The development of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS) raises profound ethical and security questions, potentially changing the nature of warfare by removing humans from the decision-making loop.
*   **Intelligence and Surveillance:** AI enhances a state's ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data for intelligence and surveillance, creating a new arms race in technological capability.
*   **Economic and Geopolitical Competition:** Leadership in AI is seen as crucial for future economic and military dominance, fueling intense competition between major powers like the US and China.

#### **(j) Discuss the functions of the international body responsible for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.**

**Answer:**

The international body primarily responsible for the peaceful use of nuclear energy is the **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)**. Established in 1957 as an autonomous organization within the United Nations system, its functions are based on three main pillars:

1.  **Safety and Security:** The IAEA develops and promotes international safety standards to protect people and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. It provides guidance and conducts peer reviews to help countries ensure the safety and security of their nuclear facilities and materials.
2.  **Safeguards and Verification (Non-Proliferation):** This is a critical function. The IAEA implements a system of safeguards to verify that nuclear material and technology intended for peaceful purposes (like power generation or medical use) are not diverted to military or weapons programs. This is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime under the **Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)**.
3.  **Science and Technology (Peaceful Uses):** The IAEA acts as a hub for international cooperation in the nuclear field. It assists member states, particularly in the developing world, in using nuclear science and technology for peaceful applications in areas such as energy, human health (e.g., cancer therapy), food and agriculture, and water management.

### **Question 2: Answer the following questions (15x3=45)**

#### **(a) Analyze the role of the United Nations in maintaining peace. Describe the main challenges for the UN in peacekeeping.**

**Answer:**

The primary mandate of the United Nations, as outlined in its Charter, is the maintenance of international peace and security. It pursues this role through a variety of mechanisms, but faces significant challenges in its peacekeeping efforts.

**Role of the UN in Maintaining Peace:**
1.  **Peacekeeping Operations:** The most visible role is the deployment of UN Peacekeepers ("Blue Helmets") to conflict zones. Their mandate can range from observing ceasefires and separating warring parties to protecting civilians, disarming combatants, and supporting political processes.
2.  **The Security Council (UNSC):** The UNSC is the principal organ with the authority to make binding decisions. It can impose sanctions, authorize the use of force, and establish peacekeeping missions to address threats to peace.
3.  **Preventive Diplomacy and Mediation:** The UN, often through the Secretary-General's office or special envoys, engages in preventive diplomacy, mediation, and negotiation to resolve disputes before they escalate into open conflict.
4.  **Peacebuilding:** After a conflict, the UN assists in peacebuilding efforts, which include rebuilding state institutions, supporting elections, promoting human rights, and facilitating economic recovery to prevent a relapse into violence.

**Main Challenges for UN Peacekeeping:**
1.  **The Veto Power:** The veto power held by the five permanent members of the UNSC (US, UK, France, Russia, China) can paralyze UN action, preventing the deployment of missions even in cases of mass atrocities if it conflicts with a P5 member's national interest.
2.  **Complex Nature of Modern Conflicts:** UN peacekeeping was designed for inter-state wars. Today's conflicts are often internal, involving non-state actors, terrorists, and organized crime, making traditional peacekeeping mandates difficult to execute.
3.  **Lack of Resources and Political Will:** The UN has no standing army and relies on member states to contribute troops and funding. Missions are often under-resourced, under-equipped, and lack the political backing needed to be effective.
4.  **Protecting Civilians:** While protecting civilians is often a core part of the mandate, peacekeepers are frequently unable to do so effectively due to restrictive rules of engagement or being outnumbered and outgunned, leading to tragic failures.

#### **(b) "Only the United States can save Palestine and Israel from a greater disaster." Do you agree with this statement? What steps do you think are necessary for a sustainable solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict?**

**Answer:**

This statement reflects the historically central and uniquely influential role of the United States in the Palestine-Israel conflict. I **partially agree** with the statement, but with significant caveats.

**Arguments for the Statement (Partial Agreement):**
The United States is the only global power with the leverage to broker a meaningful peace. This is because:
*   **Influence over Israel:** As Israel's primary military, financial, and diplomatic ally, the U.S. has unparalleled influence and the unique ability to pressure Israel into making concessions necessary for a viable peace agreement.
*   **Historical Role:** The U.S. has historically been the lead mediator, brokering key agreements like the Camp David Accords. No other actor, including the EU, Russia, or the UN, possesses a similar level of diplomatic weight in the conflict.

**Arguments Against the Statement (Caveats):**
However, the U.S. cannot act alone, and its ability is compromised because:
*   **Perceived Bias:** The U.S. is widely seen by Palestinians and the Arab world as a biased mediator due to its strong pro-Israel stance, which undermines its credibility and effectiveness.
*   **Need for Multilateralism:** A sustainable solution requires a broad international consensus and the active involvement of other key actors, including the UN, the European Union, and major Arab states, to legitimize and guarantee any agreement.

**Steps Necessary for a Sustainable Solution:**
A sustainable solution must be built on the principles of international law and address the core issues of the conflict. The necessary steps include:
1.  **A Two-State Solution:** The establishment of an independent, democratic, and viable State of Palestine living alongside a secure State of Israel, based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed land swaps.
2.  **Resolution of the Jerusalem Issue:** A negotiated settlement that recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of both states, ensuring freedom of access and worship for all religions at their holy sites.
3.  **End to Israeli Settlements:** A complete halt and reversal of the construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, which are illegal under international law and undermine the viability of a future Palestinian state.
4.  **A Just Solution for Refugees:** A fair and agreed-upon solution to the Palestinian refugee issue, based on UN Resolution 194, which could include a combination of return, resettlement, and compensation.
5.  **Security Guarantees:** Robust international security arrangements to guarantee the safety and sovereignty of both Israel and Palestine.

#### **(c) Discuss the causes of regional conflicts, displaced populations, and the refugee crisis in different parts of the world. Describe its impact on the international system and global security.**

**Answer:**

Regional conflicts are a primary driver of forced displacement, leading to massive refugee crises that profoundly impact the international system and global security.

**Causes of Regional Conflicts and Displacement:**
Regional conflicts often stem from a complex interplay of factors that force people to flee their homes:
1.  **Internal Power Struggles and Civil Wars:** Conflicts over political control, often fueled by ethnic or sectarian divisions, are a major cause. The Syrian Civil War, for example, pitted the Assad government against various rebel groups, leading to millions of displaced persons and refugees.
2.  **Ethnic and Sectarian Violence:** Persecution and violence targeted at specific ethnic or religious groups can lead to mass displacement. The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar is a clear example, where state-sponsored violence forced over a million Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh.
3.  **State Failure and Collapse:** The breakdown of state institutions creates a power vacuum, leading to widespread lawlessness and violence from which civilians must escape, as seen in Somalia or Yemen.
4.  **Intervention by External Powers:** Regional and global powers often intervene in local conflicts, prolonging and intensifying the violence and contributing to displacement.

**Displaced Populations vs. Refugee Crisis:**
*   **Displaced Population (IDPs):** People who have fled their homes but remain within their country's borders.
*   **Refugee Crisis:** Occurs when large numbers of people cross international borders to seek safety, placing them under the protection of international law (1951 Refugee Convention).

**Impact on the International System and Global Security:**
1.  **Destabilization of Neighboring States:** Large influxes of refugees can place immense strain on the resources, social fabric, and political stability of host countries (e.g., Jordan and Lebanon during the Syrian crisis).
2.  **Erosion of International Norms:** Overwhelmed by large numbers, some countries have resorted to closing borders and pushing back asylum seekers, challenging the core principles of international refugee law and the norm of non-refoulement.
3.  **Humanitarian Crises:** Refugee crises create vast humanitarian needs that often overwhelm the capacity of international organizations like the UNHCR, leading to protracted suffering in refugee camps.
4.  **Security Threats:** Large, ungoverned refugee camps can sometimes become breeding grounds for radicalization and recruitment by extremist groups. Furthermore, the cross-border nature of these crises can spread instability across regions.

### **Question 3: Answer the following question (15x1=15)**

#### **Economic development over the last decade has made Bangladesh a role model for all developing countries. Ensuring sustainable development, the main goal now is to elevate Bangladesh to the status of a developed country by 2041. In this context, explain how Bangladesh can utilize global opportunities.**

**Answer:**

Bangladesh's remarkable economic trajectory over the last decade has indeed positioned it as a development role model. Achieving its ambitious "Vision 2041" of becoming a developed nation requires a strategic and proactive approach to leveraging global opportunities. Bangladesh can harness these opportunities in the following ways:

1.  **Diversification of Exports and Moving Up the Value Chain:** The country's economy is heavily reliant on the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) sector. To build resilience and increase export earnings, Bangladesh must diversify into higher-value sectors. Global opportunities lie in pharmaceuticals (where it has already shown potential), leather goods, software and IT services, and light engineering. Securing favorable trade agreements like the EU's GSP+ status after LDC graduation will be crucial.

2.  **Attracting Quality Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):** Bangladesh needs to position itself as an attractive destination for FDI beyond the RMG sector. This involves improving the ease of doing business, ensuring political stability, and developing infrastructure. Global opportunities can be tapped by promoting its Special Economic Zones (SEZs) to international investors looking to diversify their supply chains away from a single country (like the "China Plus One" strategy).

3.  **Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR):** The global shift towards automation and digitalization presents a major opportunity. Bangladesh can leverage its large, young, tech-savvy population by investing heavily in skills training for AI, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). By creating a skilled workforce, it can become a global hub for IT outsourcing and digital services.

4.  **Developing the Blue Economy:** With a vast and exclusive maritime area in the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh has a significant opportunity to develop its blue economy. This includes sustainable deep-sea fishing, exploring for offshore energy resources (gas and renewables), developing maritime trade and shipping infrastructure, and promoting coastal tourism.

5.  **Leveraging Climate Diplomacy:** As a country highly vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh has become a global leader in climate adaptation. It can leverage this position to attract international climate finance, green technology transfers, and investment in renewable energy projects, turning a vulnerability into a strategic opportunity for sustainable development.

6.  **Strengthening Human Capital and Remittances:** Continuing to invest in education and vocational training will ensure that the Bangladeshi diaspora can secure better jobs abroad, increasing the flow of remittances, which are a vital source of foreign exchange. Engaging the non-resident Bangladeshi (NRB) community for investment and knowledge transfer is another key opportunity.

By strategically pursuing these avenues, Bangladesh can integrate more deeply and advantageously into the global economy, turning its Vision 2041 from an ambition into a reality.
