### **01. Answer the following questions (4x10=40)**

**(a) What is the Geneva Convention? Why is it important?**

The Geneva Conventions are a series of four international treaties, and their three additional protocols, that establish the international legal standards for humanitarian treatment in war. The core of the conventions was adopted in 1949 after World War II.

The four conventions cover the protection of:
1.  Wounded and sick soldiers on land.
2.  Wounded, sick, and shipwrecked military personnel at sea.
3.  Prisoners of war (POWs).
4.  Civilians, including those in occupied territory.

**Importance:** The Geneva Conventions are the bedrock of **International Humanitarian Law (IHL)**. Their importance lies in the fact that they codify the principle that even in times of armed conflict, there are limits. They aim to limit the barbarity of war by protecting people who are not, or are no longer, participating in the hostilities. They establish the fundamental rules of distinction, proportionality, and precaution, providing a universal standard of humane conduct that all states are expected to uphold.

**(b) What is the role of 'Five Eyes' in international politics?**

The 'Five Eyes' (FVEY) is the world's most comprehensive and long-standing intelligence-sharing alliance. It comprises five English-speaking countries: **the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.**

**Role in International Politics:**
*   **Intelligence Collection and Sharing:** Its primary role is the joint collection, analysis, and dissemination of signals intelligence (SIGINT) and other forms of intelligence. The members cooperate extensively to monitor the communications of foreign governments, non-state actors, and individuals.
*   **Geopolitical Monitoring:** The alliance plays a crucial role in monitoring the activities of geopolitical rivals, such as China and Russia, and potential adversaries. This shared intelligence gives its members a significant strategic advantage.
*   **Counter-Terrorism:** Since 9/11, a major focus of the Five Eyes has been on global counter-terrorism, tracking terrorist networks and preventing attacks.

The Five Eyes alliance represents a deep level of trust and integration among its members, making it a powerful and influential, albeit secretive, actor in shaping international politics.

**(c) Explain the difference between concessional and non-concessional loans with examples.**

The difference between concessional and non-concessional loans lies in the terms and conditions under which the money is lent, particularly to developing countries.

*   **Concessional Loans (or "Soft Loans"):** These loans are provided on terms that are substantially more generous than market loans. Their primary purpose is development assistance, not profit.
    *   **Characteristics:** Very low or zero interest rates, long repayment periods (e.g., 30-40 years), and extended grace periods before repayment begins.
    *   **Example:** A loan provided by the **World Bank's International Development Association (IDA)** to a least-developed country for an infrastructure project, or a loan from the **Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)**.

*   **Non-Concessional Loans (or "Hard Loans"):** These are loans provided on or near market terms.
    *   **Characteristics:** Interest rates are similar to those of commercial banks, and repayment periods are shorter.
    *   **Example:** A loan taken by a government from a **private international commercial bank** (like Citibank or Standard Chartered) or by selling sovereign bonds on the international market.

**(d) Explain the main causes of the 'Arab Spring'.**

The "Arab Spring" was a series of massive anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Arab world starting in late 2010. It was not caused by a single factor but by a combination of long-simmering grievances:

1.  **Authoritarian Rule and Political Repression:** Decades of rule by autocratic leaders, combined with a lack of political freedom, widespread corruption, and brutal state security services, created deep public resentment.
2.  **Economic Hardship:** High rates of youth unemployment, rising food prices, vast income inequality, and a perception that economic benefits were being hoarded by a corrupt elite fueled widespread anger.
3.  **Demographic Pressures:** The region had a significant "youth bulge"â€”a large population of young, educated, and tech-savvy people with few economic opportunities and no political voice.
4.  **The Catalyst of Social Media:** While not a cause in itself, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter acted as powerful catalysts, allowing protesters to organize, share information, and bypass state-controlled media, accelerating the spread of the uprisings from one country to another.

---

**(e) What is the difference between the G-20 and BRICS groupings?**

The G-20 and BRICS are both important international groupings, but they differ significantly in their composition, purpose, and orientation.

*   **Composition:**
    *   **G-20 (Group of Twenty):** It is a broad forum comprising 19 of the world's largest economies plus the European Union and the African Union. It includes both major developed countries (G7 nations) and leading emerging economies.
    *   **BRICS:** It is a smaller, more exclusive bloc composed of major **emerging economies**: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and its new members. It does not include the established Western powers.

*   **Purpose and Orientation:**
    *   **G-20:** Its primary purpose is to serve as the premier forum for **international economic cooperation and global financial governance**. It aims to manage and stabilize the existing global economic system.
    *   **BRICS:** While it also promotes economic cooperation among its members, its political orientation is often seen as a **challenge to the Western-dominated global order**. It seeks to create alternative institutions (like the New Development Bank) and promote a more multipolar world.

In essence, the G-20 works primarily to *manage* the existing global system, while BRICS often works to *reform or provide alternatives* to it.

**(f) Analyze the challenges and prospects for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region.**

The Indo-Pacific, a vast maritime super-region, has become the new center of gravity for global geopolitics. It is a region of immense dynamism but also faces significant challenges to its peace and security.

**Challenges:**
*   **US-China Strategic Competition:** The most significant challenge is the escalating strategic rivalry between the United States and China, which permeates every aspect of the region, from trade and technology to military posturing.
*   **Territorial Disputes:** Multiple unresolved territorial and maritime disputes, most notably in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, are dangerous flashpoints that could lead to armed conflict.
*   **Nuclear Proliferation:** The presence of nuclear-armed states and the unresolved North Korean nuclear issue pose a constant threat to regional stability.
*   **Non-Traditional Security Threats:** The region is highly vulnerable to piracy, terrorism, natural disasters, and the impacts of climate change.

**Prospects:**
*   **Economic Interdependence:** The high degree of economic integration and shared interest in maintaining open sea lanes for trade can act as a powerful force for peace.
*   **Regional Architecture:** A growing network of regional institutions and dialogues (like ASEAN, the East Asia Summit, and the Quad) provides platforms for cooperation and confidence-building.

**(g) Discuss the impact of climate change on international security.**

Climate change is increasingly recognized not just as an environmental issue but as a serious threat to international security. It acts as a **"threat multiplier,"** exacerbating existing tensions and creating new ones.

Key impacts include:
1.  **Resource Scarcity and Conflict:** Climate change can lead to increased competition over scarce resources like water and arable land, potentially triggering or intensifying conflicts both within and between states.
2.  **Climate-Induced Migration:** Sea-level rise, desertification, and extreme weather events can lead to the mass displacement of populations, creating refugee crises and placing immense strain on the stability of receiving states and regions.
3.  **Threats to State Stability:** The economic and social devastation caused by climate change can weaken fragile states, leading to political instability, civil unrest, and creating fertile ground for extremism and terrorism.
4.  **Geopolitical Competition in New Arenas:** The melting of the Arctic ice cap is opening up new shipping routes and access to resources, creating a new arena for geopolitical competition among Arctic and non-Arctic states.

---

**(h) What are the main challenges to sovereignty for developing countries in the current world order?**

In the contemporary globalized world, the traditional concept of absolute state sovereignty is facing significant challenges, especially for developing countries. The main challenges are:

1.  **Economic Globalization:** Powerful international financial institutions like the IMF and the World Bank can impose policy conditions (structural adjustment) on developing countries in exchange for loans, significantly constraining their economic policy choices and eroding their economic sovereignty. The actions of multinational corporations (MNCs) can also outweigh the regulatory capacity of weaker states.
2.  **International Law and Norms:** The rise of international norms like the **Responsibility to Protect (R2P)** challenges the principle of non-interference. This norm suggests that the international community has a right to intervene in a country, even without its consent, to prevent mass atrocities.
3.  **Transnational Threats:** Problems like international terrorism, pandemics, drug trafficking, and cyberattacks are borderless. A developing state's inability to control these threats on its own demonstrates the practical limits of its sovereignty.
4.  **Technological Interconnectedness:** The internet and global communication technologies make it nearly impossible for states to control the flow of information and ideas across their borders, challenging their sovereignty over the informational sphere.

---

**(i) Explain how Cyber Warfare and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can impact international relations.**

Cyber Warfare and Artificial Intelligence are transforming the nature of international relations and conflict in profound ways.

*   **Cyber Warfare:**
    *   **New Domain of Conflict:** It establishes cyberspace as a fifth domain of warfare (alongside land, sea,air, and space), where states can attack each other's critical infrastructure (power grids, financial systems) without firing a shot.
    *   **Asymmetric Advantage:** It allows smaller states or even non-state actors to inflict significant damage on much larger, more powerful nations, thus leveling the playing field of conflict.
    *   **Plausible Deniability:** Attacks can be launched with a degree of anonymity, making attribution difficult and blurring the lines between war and peace.

*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
    *   **Autonomous Weapons:** The development of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) that can independently select and engage targets without human intervention raises fundamental ethical and legal questions and could dramatically accelerate the speed of warfare.
    *   **Intelligence and Surveillance:** AI can process vast amounts of data to provide unprecedented intelligence and surveillance capabilities, creating a new arms race in AI-driven military technology.
    *   **Disinformation:** AI can be used to create highly realistic "deepfakes" and sophisticated disinformation campaigns to manipulate public opinion and destabilize foreign societies.

**(j) Discuss the functions of the international organization responsible for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.**

The international organization responsible for the peaceful use of nuclear energy is the **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)**. Established in 1957 as an autonomous organization within the UN system, its motto is "Atoms for Peace and Development."

The IAEA has a crucial dual mandate with three main functions or "pillars":

1.  **Promotion (Peaceful Uses):** It actively promotes the peaceful application of nuclear science and technology. This includes providing technical assistance to countries for using nuclear technology in areas such as electricity generation, cancer therapy, medical imaging, and improving agricultural yields.
2.  **Safeguards and Verification:** This is its most critical security function. The IAEA acts as the world's "nuclear watchdog." It implements a system of international safeguards to **verify** that nuclear material and facilities in non-nuclear-weapon states are not being diverted from peaceful use to military purposes. This is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.
3.  **Safety and Security:** The IAEA works to establish and promote international safety and security standards for nuclear power plants and the handling of radioactive materials to protect people and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation and to prevent nuclear material from falling into the hands of terrorists.

### **2. Answer any three of the following questions (15x3=45)**

**(a) Analyze the role of the United Nations in maintaining world peace. Describe the main challenges for the United Nations in peacekeeping.**

**Role of the UN in Maintaining World Peace**

The United Nations was created from the ashes of World War II with the primary objective of "saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war." Its role in maintaining world peace is multifaceted and carried out through several key mechanisms:

1.  **Preventive Diplomacy and Mediation:** The UN's most vital role is often its quietest. Through the "good offices" of the Secretary-General, special envoys, and mediators, the UN engages in preventive diplomacy to de-escalate tensions, facilitate dialogue, and prevent disputes from escalating into open conflict.
2.  **Peacekeeping Operations:** This is the most visible manifestation of the UN's peace role. The UN deploys military, police, and civilian personnel from member states (the "Blue Helmets") to conflict zones. Their mandates can range from monitoring ceasefires and protecting civilians to assisting in disarmament, demobilization, and supporting political transitions.
3.  **Peace Enforcement (Chapter VII actions):** The UN Security Council has the authority under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to take coercive measures to maintain or restore international peace. This can include imposing economic sanctions, arms embargoes, and, as a last resort, authorizing the use of collective military force, as seen in the Korean War and the first Gulf War.
4.  **Peacebuilding and Post-Conflict Reconstruction:** The UN recognizes that peace is more than the absence of war. Through its various agencies (UNDP, UNICEF, WFP), the UN plays a crucial role in post-conflict peacebuilding. This includes helping to disarm former combatants, rebuild state institutions, hold elections, promote human rights, and address the root causes of conflict to prevent a relapse into violence.

**Main Challenges for the UN in Peacekeeping:**

Despite its noble goals, the UN faces immense challenges in its peacekeeping efforts:

1.  **The Veto Power of the Permanent Five (P5):** This is the most significant political challenge. The veto power of the US, UK, France, Russia, and China in the Security Council often leads to deadlock and prevents the UN from taking decisive action in major crises where the interests of a P5 member are involved (e.g., Syria, Ukraine). This paralyzes the collective security system.
2.  **Lack of Political Will and Diverging Interests of Member States:** UN peacekeeping relies on the political will and resources of its member states. Often, national interests trump collective interests, leading to weak mandates, insufficient resources (troops, funding, equipment), and a reluctance to take risks.
3.  **Complex and Dangerous Operating Environments:** Modern conflicts are increasingly internal, not between states. Peacekeepers are often deployed into complex civil wars with multiple armed factions, no clear front lines, and where there is "no peace to keep." They face threats from asymmetric warfare, terrorism, and organized crime.
4.  **The "Expectations Gap":** The UN is often deployed into situations where it is expected to achieve miracles but is given a limited mandate and insufficient resources. This gap between the high expectations placed upon it and its actual capacity on the ground can lead to perceptions of failure.
5.  **Challenges of Conduct and Discipline:** Incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse by a minority of peacekeepers have severely damaged the UN's credibility and moral authority in some missions.

In conclusion, the UN remains an indispensable actor in global peace and security, but its effectiveness is constantly constrained by the political realities of a world of sovereign states with competing interests.

**(b) "Only the United States can save Palestine and Israel from a greater disaster." Do you agree with this statement? What steps do you think are necessary for a sustainable solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict?**

**Do I agree with the statement?**

I **partially agree** with the statement, but with significant caveats. The statement is correct in its assessment that the United States holds a unique and indispensable position in the Palestine-Israel conflict. However, it is an oversimplification to suggest that the US *alone* can save the parties from disaster.

**Arguments for the Unique Role of the US:**
*   **Israel's Primary Ally:** The United States is Israel's most powerful and steadfast ally, providing immense military, economic, and diplomatic support. No other country has the leverage or the trust with Israel to persuade it to make the difficult compromises necessary for peace.
*   **Influence over the Palestinian Authority:** The US is also a major financial donor to the Palestinian Authority and holds significant diplomatic sway over other key Arab states.
*   **Global Superpower:** As a global superpower, the US has the diplomatic weight to convene international partners and lead a credible peace process.

**Caveats and Limitations:**
*   **Perception as a Biased Mediator:** The US's deep alliance with Israel has led to a widespread perception among Palestinians and the broader Arab world that it is not an honest or impartial broker. This lack of trust severely undermines its ability to mediate effectively.
*   **Domestic Politics:** US policy on the conflict is often heavily influenced by domestic political considerations, which can prevent administrations from applying meaningful pressure on Israel.
*   **A Multilateral Effort is Required:** A sustainable solution cannot be imposed by the US alone. It requires the active and constructive involvement of other key actors, including the European Union, key Arab states (like Egypt and Jordan), and the broader international community through the United Nations.

**Steps Necessary for a Sustainable Solution:**

A sustainable solution requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses the core issues of the conflict:

1.  **A Clear Political Horizon: The Two-State Solution:** The international community, led by the US, must unequivocally reaffirm its commitment to the two-state solution as the only viable path to peace. This involves the establishment of an independent, democratic, and viable State of Palestine, based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed land swaps, living side-by-side in peace and security with the State of Israel.
2.  **End of Settlement Expansion:** There must be an immediate and complete halt to all Israeli settlement construction and expansion in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The continued expansion of settlements is the single greatest obstacle to a two-state solution, as it erodes the territorial basis for a future Palestinian state.
3.  **Addressing the Core Issues:** A final status agreement must be negotiated to resolve the core issues:
    *   **Borders:** Based on the 1967 lines.
    *   **Jerusalem:** A shared capital for both states.
    *   **Refugees:** A just, agreed, and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue.
    *   **Security:** Arrangements that guarantee the security of both Israel and Palestine.
4.  **Palestinian Reconciliation:** The internal division between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza must be overcome. A unified and legitimate Palestinian leadership is essential for negotiating and implementing a peace agreement.
5.  **Meaningful International Pressure:** The international community, especially the US, must be willing to apply meaningful diplomatic and political pressure on both parties to make the necessary compromises. This means moving beyond rhetoric to create real consequences for actions that undermine the peace process.

In conclusion, while the United States has a uniquely powerful role to play, a sustainable peace can only be achieved through a renewed and credible multilateral peace process, grounded in international law and a firm commitment to a two-state solution.

### **03. The economic development of the last decade has turned Bangladesh into a role model for all developing countries. Ensuring sustainable development and bringing Bangladesh into the ranks of developed countries by 2041 is now the main goal. Explain how Bangladesh can take advantage of global opportunities to achieve this goal.**

Bangladesh's journey over the last decade has indeed been remarkable, making it a "role model" for development. To achieve its ambitious goal of becoming a developed nation by 2041, the country must strategically navigate the global landscape and capitalize on emerging opportunities. This requires a proactive and visionary approach that looks beyond its current strengths.

Bangladesh can take advantage of global opportunities in the following key areas:

**1. Economic Diversification and Moving Up the Value Chain:**
*   **The Opportunity:** The global economy is constantly shifting. While the Ready-Made Garment (RMG) sector has been our engine of growth, over-reliance on it is a risk. The opportunity lies in diversifying into new, higher-value sectors.
*   **How to Capitalize:**
    *   **Targeting New Industries:** Proactively promote and incentivize investment in promising sectors like **pharmaceuticals, information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services, light engineering, leather goods, and agro-processing.**
    *   **Moving Up the Value Chain in RMG:** Shift from basic garment production to high-end, value-added products, including fashion design, branding, and technical textiles. This means investing in R&D and design institutes.

**2. Leveraging the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR):**
*   **The Opportunity:** The 4IR, driven by AI, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT), is transforming global production. This is an opportunity to leapfrog traditional industrial stages.
*   **How to Capitalize:**
    *   **Building a Skilled Workforce:** Massively invest in high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and vocational training to create a workforce that is "4IR-ready."
    *   **Attracting Tech FDI:** Create a favorable ecosystem for technology-based foreign direct investment by establishing high-tech parks, ensuring reliable energy and internet connectivity, and offering attractive incentives.

**3. Tapping into New and Emerging Markets:**
*   **The Opportunity:** As Bangladesh prepares to graduate from the LDC category, it will lose some preferential trade access to traditional markets like the EU. The opportunity is to aggressively seek new markets.
*   **How to Capitalize:**
    *   **Negotiating Free Trade Agreements (FTAs):** Actively pursue FTAs and Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) with individual countries and regional blocs, especially in **Asia (ASEAN), Africa, and Latin America.**
    *   **Strengthening Economic Diplomacy:** Task diplomatic missions with the primary goal of market exploration and trade promotion, providing businesses with the intelligence and support they need to enter new markets.

**4. Capitalizing on Geopolitical Shifts and the "Blue Economy":**
*   **The Opportunity:** Global supply chains are diversifying away from over-concentration in China. Bangladesh's strategic location makes it an attractive alternative destination for manufacturing and investment. Furthermore, our vast maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal represents a massive "Blue Economy" frontier.
*   **How to Capitalize:**
    *   **Improving the Business Climate:** Drastically improve the ease of doing business by simplifying regulations, ensuring policy consistency, and tackling corruption to attract the relocating investment.
    *   **Developing the Blue Economy:** Attract investment and technology for the sustainable exploitation of marine resources, including deep-sea fishing, marine renewable energy, and seabed mineral exploration.

**5. Mobilizing Climate Finance:**
*   **The Opportunity:** As a country highly vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh is well-positioned to access the growing pool of international climate finance available for adaptation and mitigation projects.
*   **How to Capitalize:** Develop a strong pipeline of bankable "green" projects in areas like renewable energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and sustainable agriculture to attract funding from bodies like the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and multilateral development banks.

To achieve Vision 2041, Bangladesh must be agile, innovative, and outward-looking. By strategically diversifying its economy, embracing new technologies, seeking new markets, and improving its governance, it can successfully harness global opportunities to make the leap from a developing nation to a prosperous, developed country.
