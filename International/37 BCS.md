Of course. Here are the detailed answers to all parts of Question 1, translated and elaborated in English, adhering to a formal and academic tone.

***

### **1. Discuss briefly the following ten topics:**

**(a) What is the difference between International Relations and International Politics?**

The distinction between International Relations (IR) and International Politics (IP) is one of scope and focus, akin to differentiating a vast landscape from the prominent mountains that define its contours.

**International Relations (IR)** is the broader, holistic academic discipline dedicated to the study of all forms of interactions that transcend national boundaries. Its purview is expansive, encompassing not only political and diplomatic exchanges but also economic, social, cultural, legal, and ecological connections between a diverse array of global actors. These actors include states, international organizations (e.g., the UN), non-governmental organizations (e.g., Amnesty International), multinational corporations, and even individuals. IR, as a field of study, seeks to understand the complex web of global interconnectedness in its entirety.

**International Politics (IP)**, conversely, is a critical subset of International Relations. It is primarily concerned with the nexus of power, conflict, and cooperation among states in the international system. Rooted in the works of thinkers like Hans Morgenthau, IP focuses on the high politics of diplomacy, war, security, and the strategic pursuit of national interests. It is the study of the process by which influence is wielded and policy is decided on the global stage, making it the dynamic, power-centric core around which much of the broader field of IR revolves.

In essence, while all of International Politics falls under the umbrella of International Relations, not all of International Relations can be classified as International Politics.

**(b) What is the significance of sovereignty as an element of statehood?**

Sovereignty is not merely an element of statehood; it is arguably its quintessential and defining attribute, the very legal and political bedrock upon which the modern state system rests. Its significance is twofold, manifesting as both internal and external authority.

1.  **Internal Sovereignty:** This refers to the supreme and absolute authority of the state within its own territorial boundaries. It is the power to legislate, adjudicate, and enforce laws without interference from any other internal entity. This grants the state a monopoly on the legitimate use of force and establishes a final point of authority, ensuring domestic order and governance.

2.  **External Sovereignty:** This is the principle of national independence. It signifies that the state is autonomous and not subject to the dictates of any external power. It is this facet that underpins the legal equality of all states in the international system, regardless of their size or power, and gives rise to the foundational principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other states, as enshrined in the UN Charter.

As codified in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, which outlines the four criteria for statehood (a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states), sovereignty is the implicit lifeblood that animates the latter two. Without it, a government lacks ultimate authority, and the capacity to engage with other states as an equal peer is non-existent.

---

**(c) What are the external determinants of foreign policy formulation?**

A nation's foreign policy is a carefully crafted edifice, shaped by an intricate interplay of internal pressures and external realities. The external determinants, or exogenous variables, are those factors existing outside the state's borders that constrain, influence, and provide opportunities for its actions on the world stage. The most salient of these include:

*   **The International System's Structure:** The prevailing global distribution of power—be it unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar—fundamentally shapes a state's strategic options. In a bipolar world, for instance, alignment with a superpower bloc is often a necessity, whereas a multipolar system offers greater flexibility for alliances and maneuvering.
*   **International Law and Organizations:** The norms, treaties, and conventions of international law (e.g., the Law of the Sea), as well as the resolutions and charters of international bodies like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, establish a normative framework that both limits and legitimizes state actions.
*   **The Geopolitical Environment:** The actions, policies, and power of neighboring states and regional powers are of paramount importance. A state's foreign policy is perpetually in a dynamic of action and reaction with the policies of its allies, rivals, and neighbors.
*   **Global Economic Conditions:** The state of the global economy, the flow of capital, trade dependencies, and the influence of international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank can profoundly impact a nation's economic statecraft and foreign policy orientation.
*   **Non-State Actors and Global Public Opinion:** The influence of powerful multinational corporations (MNCs), transnational advocacy networks, international media, and global public opinion can exert significant pressure on states to alter or justify their foreign policy choices, particularly on issues like human rights and the environment.

**(d) What is the framework for inter-country road connectivity among Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, and Nepal?**

The framework for inter-country road connectivity among these four nations is the **Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA)**. This is a landmark sub-regional initiative designed to create a seamless transit system for vehicles, thereby catalyzing economic integration and bolstering people-to-people connections.

Signed in 2015, the core architecture of the BBIN MVA is built upon the following principles:

1.  **Regulation of Traffic:** The agreement allows for the movement of passenger, personal, and cargo vehicles across the borders of the signatory nations.
2.  **Permit-Based System:** Vehicles from one country can enter another's territory upon obtaining a permit, streamlining the previously cumbersome process of trans-loading goods and changing vehicles at the border.
3.  **Harmonization of Regulations:** The framework aims to harmonize regulations, customs protocols, and transport documentation among the four countries to facilitate smoother and faster transit.
4.  **Economic Objective:** The ultimate goal is to reduce transport costs, foster greater intra-regional trade, enhance tourism, and create a more integrated economic corridor in South Asia, leveraging the geographical contiguity of the member nations.

While Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have ratified the agreement, Bhutan's ratification has been pending due to environmental and livelihood concerns. Nevertheless, the BBIN MVA represents the most significant and structured framework for road connectivity in this vital sub-region.

**(e) What is the difference between regionalism and regionalization?**

Though often used interchangeably, regionalism and regionalization are complementary yet distinct phenomena that describe two different facets of regional integration.

**Regionalism** refers to the formal, top-down, and state-centric political project of creating regional cooperation and institutional arrangements. It is a conscious policy choice made by governments to form regional blocs, sign treaties, and build intergovernmental organizations. The creation of the European Union (EU) or the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) are classic examples of regionalism. It is a *de jure* process, driven by political will and diplomatic negotiation.

**Regionalization**, in contrast, is the informal, bottom-up, and often market- or society-driven process of increasing economic, social, and cultural interdependence within a geographical region. It is the organic growth of cross-border trade, investment, migration, and cultural exchange that occurs with or without formal state-level agreements. The burgeoning of informal trade networks or the spread of cultural products across a region are manifestations of regionalization. It is a *de facto* process, driven by the actions of private firms, communities, and individuals.

In short, regionalism is the *project* of integration, while regionalization is the *process* of integration.

**(f) According to the International Law of the Sea, what is meant by the specialized economic area known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)?**

The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a juridical zone of the sea, enshrined in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), that grants specific resource rights to a coastal state.

The EEZ is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, extending no more than **200 nautical miles** from the coastal state's baselines (the low-water line along the coast).

Within this zone, the coastal state does not have full sovereignty as it does in its territorial waters. Instead, it has:

1.  **Sovereign Rights:** For the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing the natural resources, whether living (e.g., fisheries) or non-living (e.g., oil and gas), of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of the seabed and its subsoil. This also includes rights concerning other activities for the economic exploitation of the zone, such as the production of energy from water, currents, and winds.
2.  **Jurisdiction:** Over the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations, and structures; marine scientific research; and the protection and preservation of the marine environment.

Crucially, all other states retain the high seas freedoms of navigation, overflight, and the laying of submarine cables and pipelines within the EEZ, subject to the relevant provisions of the Convention. The EEZ thus represents a delicate legal balance between the resource interests of coastal states and the navigational freedoms of the international community.

**(g) What is 'Dual Track' (or Two-Track) diplomacy?**

Dual Track, more commonly known as Two-Track Diplomacy, is a sophisticated, multi-layered approach to conflict resolution that combines official and unofficial diplomatic efforts. It recognizes that formal government-to-government negotiations are often constrained by political posturing and public scrutiny.

The two tracks are:

*   **Track One Diplomacy:** This is the realm of official statecraft. It involves formal negotiations, discussions, and interactions conducted by heads of state, ministers, diplomats, and other government officials. These are official, binding negotiations that represent the state's formal position.

*   **Track Two Diplomacy:** This involves unofficial, non-structured interaction and problem-solving activities conducted by influential non-governmental actors. These actors can be academics, retired senior officials, civil society leaders, or other private citizens. The purpose of Track Two is to foster dialogue, build trust, and explore creative solutions to a conflict in an informal setting, away from the pressures of official diplomacy. It can help humanize the "enemy" and generate new ideas that can later be fed into the official Track One process.

'Dual Track' diplomacy is the strategic, often parallel, application of both tracks to manage or resolve a conflict, where the unofficial dialogues of Track Two complement and facilitate the official negotiations of Track One.

**(h) What is meant by Soft Power?**

Coined and developed by the political scientist Joseph S. Nye Jr., **Soft Power** is the ability of a state to influence the preferences and behaviors of other international actors and obtain its desired outcomes through attraction and persuasion, rather than through coercion (Hard Power) or payment (economic inducement). It is the co-optive power of getting others to want what you want.

The currency of soft power is not force or money, but a country's intangible assets. Nye identifies three primary sources of a nation's soft power:

1.  **Its Culture:** When a country's culture (e.g., its art, music, literature, cinema, and popular trends) is perceived as attractive and appealing to others, it generates admiration and influence.
2.  **Its Political Values:** When a state consistently upholds values such as democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, both at home and abroad, it can inspire others and lend its foreign policy a powerful moral authority.
3.  **Its Foreign Policies:** When a country's foreign policies are perceived as legitimate, inclusive, and having moral authority, other states are more likely to cooperate and follow its lead.

In essence, soft power is the power of example and attraction, a vital component of modern statecraft in an interconnected world.

**(i) Briefly explain the concepts of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).**

The MDGs and SDGs are two successive, landmark global commitments designed to address the world's most pressing development challenges, with the latter representing a significant evolution from the former.

**The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)** were a set of 8 goals with 21 targets, established in 2000 for achievement by 2015. They were groundbreaking in their focus on measurable, time-bound objectives. The MDGs primarily targeted social development indicators in developing countries, with a focus on halving extreme poverty, achieving universal primary education, reducing child mortality, and combating diseases like HIV/AIDS. While highly successful in galvanizing global effort, they were often critiqued for being a top-down, donor-driven agenda that did not fully integrate environmental concerns.

**The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** are the successor framework, adopted in 2015 with a target date of 2030. They represent a paradigm shift in development thinking. The SDGs are a much broader and more ambitious agenda, comprising 17 goals and 169 targets. Their core distinction lies in their:
*   **Universality:** They apply to all countries—developed and developing alike.
*   **Integration:** They holistically blend the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic prosperity, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.
*   **Comprehensiveness:** They cover a wider range of issues, including inequality, climate change, sustainable consumption, peace, and justice.

The central promise of the SDGs is to "Leave No One Behind," signaling a move from a development agenda for the poor to a universal agenda for all humanity.

**(j) What were the key decisions of COP22?**

The 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP22) to the UNFCCC was held in Marrakech, Morocco, in November 2016. Coming just after the landmark Paris Agreement (COP21), its primary purpose was to begin the technical work of implementation. Dubbed the "COP of Action," its key decisions and outcomes were:

1.  **The Marrakech Action Proclamation for Our Climate and Sustainable Development:** This was a strong, unified political statement from world leaders reaffirming their "highest political commitment" to the Paris Agreement. It was a crucial signal of global resolve and irreversible momentum, particularly in the face of political uncertainties following the U.S. presidential election.
2.  **Advancing the Paris "Rulebook":** The central task was to start crafting the detailed rules and procedures needed to implement the Paris Agreement. COP22 established a clear work programme with a deadline to complete this "rulebook" by 2018. This included rules on transparency, accounting for climate action (NDCs), and the global stocktake.
3.  **Capacity Building and Finance:** The Paris Committee on Capacity-building (PCCB) was operationalized to help developing countries build the institutional and technical ability to meet their climate commitments. There was also a strong push for progress on the goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing nations.
4.  **Strengthening Adaptation Efforts:** A significant decision was made that the Adaptation Fund, established under the Kyoto Protocol, would also serve the Paris Agreement, ensuring its continued role in financing crucial adaptation projects in vulnerable countries.

In essence, if Paris was the celebration of a historic agreement, Marrakech was the sober start of the hard work required to bring it to life.

Of course. Here are the detailed answers to all parts of Question 1, translated and elaborated in English, adhering to a formal and academic tone.

Of course. Here are comprehensive, essay-style answers to the questions in sections 2 and 3, crafted in a formal and academic tone as requested.

### **2. Answer any three of the following questions:**

*(Note: For the purpose of providing a comprehensive resource, answers to all four questions are provided below.)*

**(a) Critically review the governance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In light of the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), discuss the challenges that the ADB's operations might face.**

The landscape of multilateral development finance in Asia is undergoing a profound transformation, moving from an era dominated by established Bretton Woods-style institutions to a more complex and competitive environment. At the heart of this shift lies the dynamic interplay between the long-standing Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the emergent Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). A critical examination of the ADB's governance reveals the very factors that created the space for the AIIB's rise and illuminates the nature of the challenges the ADB now confronts.

The governance structure of the ADB, established in 1966, has long been a subject of critical scrutiny. Modeled on the World Bank, its system of capital subscription-based voting power has resulted in a durable and disproportionate influence wielded by its largest non-regional members, the United States, and its largest regional member, Japan. This has led to a persistent critique that the institution is an instrument of the foreign policy and economic interests of these powers, rather than a truly Asia-centric body. The unwritten tradition of the ADB presidency being perpetually held by a Japanese national is a potent symbol of this perceived hegemony. Furthermore, the ADB has often been criticized for its institutional inertia—a slow, bureaucratic decision-making process laden with stringent loan conditionalities that reflect the "Washington Consensus" economic orthodoxy. These conditionalities, while intended to promote good governance and market reform, have at times been viewed as infringing upon the policy sovereignty of recipient nations and being ill-suited to local contexts.

It is precisely against this backdrop that the China-led AIIB, inaugurated in 2016, poses a multifaceted challenge to the ADB. This challenge is not merely one of competition but of paradigm.

First, the **AIIB presents an alternative governance model**. While China is the largest shareholder, it has deliberately structured the bank to appear more inclusive, attracting a wide array of members, including key U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and Germany. By forgoing veto power, China has positioned the AIIB as a "lean, clean, and green" institution that is potentially more responsive to the needs of developing Asian nations. This directly challenges the entrenched Japan-U.S. dominance at the ADB and creates pressure for internal reform.

Second, the **AIIB introduces significant operational competition**. With a stated focus on closing Asia's colossal infrastructure deficit, the AIIB competes directly with the ADB for projects. Its promise of faster loan approvals and potentially less stringent political conditionalities could make it a more attractive option for borrowing countries, forcing the ADB to become more efficient, flexible, and competitive in its own operations to retain its relevance.

Finally, the **AIIB's very existence alters the strategic calculus of development finance**. It provides Asian nations with greater choice and leverage. They are no longer solely dependent on the ADB and the World Bank. This dynamic could either lead to a "race to the bottom" regarding social and environmental standards or, more optimistically, foster a "competitive coexistence" where both banks push each other to improve performance, collaborate on large-scale projects, and ultimately better serve the development needs of the region.

In conclusion, the rise of the AIIB is not an existential threat to the ADB but a powerful catalyst for change. The challenge it presents is a call for the ADB to reform its governance, streamline its operations, and prove its continued value in a newly multipolar world of development finance. The ultimate beneficiary of this new dynamic may well be Asia itself.

**(b) Discuss the context and current situation of Iran's nuclear program. What is the impact of the 2016 agreement with several countries, including the United States? What might be the future of Iran-U.S. relations in light of the new U.S. president's inauguration?**

The Iranian nuclear program has for decades been one of the most intractable and perilous issues in international security, a focal point of geopolitical tension between Iran and the Western world. The program's context is rooted in a deep-seated national ambition for technological mastery and strategic autonomy, while the "current situation" (as of late 2016/early 2017) is defined by a landmark diplomatic achievement whose future hangs in a delicate and uncertain balance.

**Context and the 2015 Agreement:** For years, the international community, led by the United States and Israel, harbored profound suspicions that Iran's ostensibly peaceful nuclear energy program was a clandestine effort to develop nuclear weapons. This led to a progressively tightening web of crippling international sanctions imposed by the UN, US, and EU, which devastated the Iranian economy. In response, Iran accelerated its uranium enrichment activities, creating a dangerous cycle of escalation that brought the region to the brink of military conflict. The breakthrough came with the **Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)**, signed in July 2015 and implemented in January 2016. This historic agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) was a masterclass in diplomacy. Its impact was immediate and transformative: Iran agreed to verifiably and significantly roll back its nuclear program—drastically reducing its stockpile of enriched uranium, dismantling thousands of centrifuges, and accepting the most intrusive international inspections regime ever negotiated. In return, all nuclear-related international sanctions were lifted, allowing Iran to re-engage with the global economy. The JCPOA successfully de-escalated a major nuclear proliferation crisis without a single shot being fired.

**The Future of Iran-U.S. Relations and the New Presidency:** The inauguration of a new U.S. president in January 2017 cast a profound cloud of uncertainty over this monumental diplomatic achievement. The incoming U.S. administration had vehemently and repeatedly denounced the JCPOA on the campaign trail, labeling it "the worst deal ever negotiated" and threatening to dismantle it. This created a precarious future for Iran-U.S. relations, which had just begun a tentative thaw.

The potential ramifications of a hostile U.S. posture were severe. A unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the agreement would likely trigger its complete collapse. It would not only re-impose crippling sanctions on Iran but would also isolate the United States from its European allies, who remained staunch supporters of the deal. For Iran, the incentive to adhere to its stringent obligations would evaporate, raising the specter of a rapid resumption of its unconstrained nuclear activities. This would, in turn, reignite the very crisis the JCPOA had so carefully defused, potentially setting the Middle East on a path toward a catastrophic war and sparking a regional nuclear arms race.

In conclusion, the period following the 2016 U.S. election represented a critical juncture. The JCPOA stood as a testament to the power of multilateral diplomacy to resolve complex security threats. However, its survival depended on the continued commitment of all parties. The shift in the U.S. administration's stance threatened to unravel this fragile peace, demonstrating how deeply the future of international security can be swayed by the vicissitudes of domestic politics in a major global power.

**(c) Write an essay on the relationship between China and India. Discuss the impact of this relationship on South Asia, particularly in light of China's growing influence.**

The relationship between China and India is arguably the most consequential and complex bilateral dynamic in the 21st century. It is a profound dichotomy of deepening economic cooperation and intensifying strategic competition, a partnership of convenience in some global forums and a rivalry of ambition across the Asian continent. The trajectory of this relationship does not merely determine the future of its 2.8 billion people; it fundamentally reshapes the geopolitical architecture of South Asia and the wider Indo-Pacific.

The Sino-Indian relationship is defined by a delicate balance. On one hand, economic interdependence has grown exponentially. China is one of India's largest trading partners, and both nations are key pillars of multilateral groupings like the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). They often find common cause in advocating for the interests of the developing world on global platforms, from climate negotiations to reforms of international financial institutions.

On the other hand, this cooperation is perpetually shadowed by deep-seated strategic mistrust. The unresolved border dispute in the Himalayas remains a persistent source of tension, flaring up periodically into military standoffs. More broadly, a quiet struggle for regional dominance is underway. India watches with deep apprehension as China pursues its "String of Pearls" strategy—a network of ports and infrastructure projects across the Indian Ocean—and massively expands its influence through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China's all-weather alliance with Pakistan, particularly the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which runs through Pakistan-administered Kashmir, is viewed by New Delhi as a direct challenge to its sovereignty and security.

This complex Sino-Indian dynamic has a powerful and transformative impact on the rest of South Asia. For smaller nations in the region, such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Maldives, China's rise offers unprecedented opportunities.

First, **it creates economic alternatives and leverage**. China's massive infrastructure investments through the BRI provide these nations with a new source of capital, helping to build ports, power plants, and highways that they desperately need. This lessens their traditional dependence on India and allows them to play the two Asian giants against each other to secure more favorable terms for aid and investment.

Second, **it intensifies geopolitical competition within South Asia**. The region, once considered India's undisputed sphere of influence, is now a key arena for Sino-Indian rivalry. India has responded to China's inroads with its own "Neighborhood First" and "Act East" policies, ramping up its development assistance and connectivity projects to counter Beijing's influence. This competition can be destabilizing, as seen in the political turbulence within smaller nations as they navigate the competing pressures from New Delhi and Beijing.

In conclusion, the relationship between China and India acts as the central axis around which the geopolitics of South Asia revolves. While their economic engagement offers a path toward shared prosperity, their strategic rivalry injects a new layer of complexity and contestation into the region. For the smaller states of South Asia, this dynamic is both a boon and a burden, offering new avenues for development while demanding a deft and perilous diplomatic balancing act. The future stability and prosperity of the entire subcontinent are inextricably linked to how these two rising powers choose to manage their intricate relationship.

**(d) What is the current state of SAARC as a South Asian development organization? Is it necessary to amend the SAARC Charter to enhance its future role? What kind of changes would make SAARC more effective?**

The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), founded with the noble vision of fostering regional integration and collective self-reliance, currently exists in a state of suspended animation. Conceived as a vehicle for development, its journey has been perpetually stalled by political friction, rendering it one of the least integrated regional blocs in the world. To revitalize this moribund organization and realize its founding promise, a fundamental reconsideration of its core principles, including a necessary amendment of its Charter, is imperative.

The current state of SAARC is one of profound ineffectiveness. The organization is held hostage by the enduring and acrimonious rivalry between its two largest members, India and Pakistan. This political schism has poisoned the well of cooperation, leading to the frequent postponement of summits—the lifeblood of any intergovernmental body—and the paralysis of key initiatives. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), for instance, remains largely aspirational, with intra-regional trade languishing at a mere 5% of the members' total trade, a stark contrast to more successful blocs like ASEAN. Consequently, SAARC has largely failed in its primary mission to become a true engine for South Asian development.

At the heart of this paralysis lies the SAARC Charter itself, whose foundational principles have become its fatal flaws. Specifically, two articles are critically debilitating:
1.  **The Principle of Unanimity:** Article X of the Charter mandates that all decisions must be made by unanimous consent. This has effectively granted every member state a veto, allowing a single nation to obstruct any proposal, regardless of the consensus among the other members.
2.  **The Exclusion of Bilateral Issues:** The Charter explicitly forbids the discussion of "bilateral and contentious issues." While intended to prevent the organization from being bogged down by disputes, this rule has had the perverse effect of ignoring the very conflicts that undermine its existence.

Therefore, amending the Charter is not merely desirable; it is a prerequisite for SAARC's survival and relevance. The following changes are essential to make the organization more effective:

First, **reform the decision-making process**. The unanimity principle must be replaced. A more pragmatic approach, such as a "SAARC minus X" formula, should be adopted. This would allow a coalition of willing members to proceed with projects and initiatives without being held hostage by one or two dissenting states. This would foster a multi-speed SAARC, where progress is possible even if universal consensus is not.

Second, **create a mechanism for conflict resolution**. While SAARC should not become a forum for bilateral mudslinging, the absolute prohibition on contentious issues must be relaxed. An informal mechanism for dialogue or a dedicated council for political and security cooperation could be established, providing a much-needed platform to build trust and manage the conflicts that currently cripple the organization from the outside.

Finally, **empower the SAARC Secretariat and prioritize tangible connectivity**. The Secretariat needs to be transformed from a passive administrative body into a proactive institution with the mandate and resources to identify, design, and drive regional projects. The focus should shift from declarative politics to the implementation of tangible projects in energy, transport, trade facilitation, and people-to-people connectivity that create visible benefits and build a constituency for regionalism from the ground up.

In conclusion, SAARC stands at a crossroads. To move from a symbol of unfulfilled potential to a substantive force for development, it must undergo bold structural and normative reform. Amending its charter to break the chains of unanimity and address political realities, coupled with a pragmatic focus on tangible results, is the only viable path to revitalizing this crucial but languishing institution.

### **3. After the 1971 independence of Bangladesh, several unresolved issues with Pakistan remain. One of these is related to Assets and Liability. Recently, Pakistan has expressed some opinions on this matter. As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, discuss the steps that could be taken to resolve this issue.**

**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
**FROM:** [An Official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs]
**DATE:** [Current Date]
**SUBJECT:** A Proposed Diplomatic Strategy for the Resolution of Outstanding Assets and Liabilities with Pakistan

**1. Introduction and Context**

This memorandum outlines a multi-phased, pragmatic strategy for resolving the long-standing and historically significant issue of the division of assets and liabilities of the pre-1971 state of Pakistan. The recent statements emanating from Islamabad, which appear to abjure any financial obligation to Bangladesh, have reignited this issue, making it imperative for Bangladesh to pursue a resolution with renewed vigor and a clear, structured approach. A just settlement of this matter is not only a question of economic right and historical justice for the people of Bangladesh but also a necessary step towards the full normalization of bilateral relations based on mutual respect and international law.

**2. Guiding Principles**

Our strategy should be guided by the following principles:
*   **Evidence-Based:** Our claim must be built upon meticulous research and irrefutable documentation.
*   **Legally Sound:** Our position must be firmly grounded in the established principles of international law concerning state succession.
*   **Diplomatically Proactive:** We must move from a reactive posture to proactively setting the agenda.
*   **Phased and Calibrated:** Our approach should begin with bilateral engagement and escalate methodically if necessary.

**3. Proposed Strategic Phases**

I recommend a three-phased approach to pursue our claim:

**Phase I: Meticulous Internal Preparation and Consolidation**

The foundation of any successful diplomatic initiative is comprehensive preparation.
*   **Establish an Inter-Ministerial Task Force:** A high-powered task force, chaired by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, must be immediately constituted. It should include senior representatives from the Ministry of Finance (Economic Relations Division), the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, the Bangladesh Bank, and the Ministry of Commerce.
*   **Comprehensive Archival Research and Valuation:** The task force's primary mandate will be to consolidate all historical claims and update their valuation. This involves:
    *   Quantifying Bangladesh's rightful share of the assets held by the State Bank of Pakistan as of December 1971 (gold reserves, foreign currency).
    *   Valuating our share in state-owned enterprises like Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the National Shipping Corporation, and other federal entities.
    *   Compiling all relevant documents, including the Tripartite Agreement of 1974, which explicitly acknowledges that this issue will be settled at a later date.
*   **Legal Fortification:** The Ministry of Law must prepare a definitive legal brief establishing the validity of our claim under the doctrine of state succession. This brief will serve as the cornerstone of our diplomatic argumentation.

**Phase II: Proactive Bilateral and Multilateral Diplomatic Engagement**

Once our internal preparations are complete, we must engage diplomatically on multiple fronts.
*   **Formal Bilateral Demarche:** The first and primary course of action is direct engagement. We must formally raise the issue with Pakistan through a diplomatic Note Verbale, presenting a summary of our consolidated, evidence-based claim. This should be followed by seeking dedicated talks at the Foreign Secretary level. The objective is to initiate a formal negotiation process.
*   **Public and Track-Two Diplomacy:** To create a supportive international environment, we should:
    *   Commission and encourage academic studies and seminars on the issue at national and international think tanks.
    *   Subtly brief international media and influential journalists on the historical facts and justice of our claim.
    *   Engage our development partners and friendly nations, providing them with a non-paper that clearly outlines our position. This is not to seek their intervention but to ensure the international community is aware of the facts should the issue escalate.

**Phase III: Exploration of Third-Party and Legal Mechanisms**

If persistent and sincere bilateral efforts fail to yield progress, we must be prepared to escalate our approach.
*   **Proposal for Mediation:** We should formally propose the option of good offices or mediation by a neutral and mutually respected third party. This could be a friendly country (e.g., Turkey, Saudi Arabia) or an international personality of high repute, such as the UN Secretary-General. This step demonstrates our commitment to a peaceful resolution.
*   **Exploring International Arbitration:** As a final resort, we should state our willingness to submit the dispute to binding international arbitration, for example, at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at The Hague. While arbitration requires the consent of both parties, our public willingness to pursue this path will place the diplomatic onus on Pakistan to either negotiate in good faith or be seen as rejecting a rules-based resolution.

**4. Conclusion**

The resolution of the assets and liabilities issue is a matter of national priority. By adopting a strategy that is methodical, evidence-based, and diplomatically sophisticated, we can pursue our rightful claim from a position of strength. The objective is not confrontation, but the pursuit of a just, amicable, and final settlement that will close a painful chapter of our history and allow for a more constructive and forward-looking relationship with Pakistan. I stand ready to elaborate on this proposed strategy in further detail.
