Of course. Here are the detailed answers for all the short-note questions from Section 1 of the provided exam paper.

***

### **1. Brief Discussion on any ten of the following topics (4x10 = 40)**

**(a) What is the difference between International Relations and International Politics?**

While often used interchangeably, International Relations (IR) and International Politics (IP) are distinct concepts in political science.

*   **International Relations (IR):** This is the broader, more comprehensive academic field of study. It encompasses *all* forms of interactions between international actors, not just states. This includes economic relations (trade, finance), international law, cultural exchanges, and the roles of non-state actors like international organizations (UN, WTO), multinational corporations (MNCs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). IR seeks to understand the entire global system in all its complexity.

*   **International Politics (IP):** This is a *sub-field* of International Relations. It focuses specifically on the power relationships and political interactions between states. Its primary concerns are issues of war and peace, foreign policy, diplomacy, alliances, national interest, and the balance of power. IP is essentially the study of how states use their power to achieve their political goals on the global stage.

**In essence:** IR is the entire forest, including all the trees, animals, and the ecosystem. International Politics is the study of the struggle for dominance among the largest trees in that forest.

**(b) What is the importance of sovereignty as an element of the state?**

Sovereignty is the most essential and defining element of a state. It refers to the supreme and legitimate authority a state possesses. Its importance is twofold:

1.  **Internal Importance:** Internally, sovereignty gives the state the ultimate authority to make and enforce laws, maintain order, and command the loyalty of its population within its defined territory. Without sovereignty, a political entity would lack the final authority to govern, leading to anarchy or control by competing powers. It is the foundation of a state's legal system and its right to rule.

2.  **External Importance:** Externally, sovereignty means the state is independent and free from the control of any other state. This independence allows it to conduct its own foreign policy, enter into treaties, join international organizations, and defend its territorial integrity. Under the principle of sovereign equality enshrined in the UN Charter, all sovereign states are legally equal in the international system, regardless of their size or power.

Therefore, sovereignty is the critical element that distinguishes a state from all other forms of human association and grants it legal personality on the international stage.

---

**(c) What are the external determinants of foreign policy?**

The foreign policy of a state is not formulated in a vacuum; it is heavily influenced by factors and conditions outside its borders. These external determinants include:

1.  **The International System:** The prevailing global power structure—whether it is unipolar (one dominant power), bipolar (two), or multipolar (many)—profoundly shapes a state's options and strategies.
2.  **Policies and Actions of Other States:** The foreign policy of a nation is often a direct reaction to the actions of other states, especially neighboring countries and major global powers. An arms build-up by a rival, the formation of a new alliance, or a trade war all necessitate a foreign policy response.
3.  **International Law and Organizations:** A state's behavior is constrained by its obligations under international law, treaties, and the charters of organizations it belongs to (e.g., the UN, WTO). These institutions create norms and rules that influence decision-making.
4.  **Global Public Opinion and Non-State Actors:** In an interconnected world, global public opinion, international media, and powerful NGOs (like Amnesty International or Greenpeace) can exert pressure on states, particularly on issues of human rights and the environment, thereby influencing their foreign policy.

**(d) What is the framework for road connectivity between Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, and Nepal?**

The framework for inter-country road connectivity between Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, and Nepal is the **Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) Initiative**.

The centerpiece of this initiative is the **BBIN Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA)**, signed by the transport ministers of the four countries in June 2015.

*   **Objective:** The primary goal of the MVA is to create a seamless system for the cross-border movement of vehicles. It aims to allow cargo trucks, passenger buses, and personal vehicles from one member country to travel through the territory of others with minimal procedural hurdles.
*   **Purpose:** By simplifying transit, the agreement seeks to boost regional trade, promote tourism, and foster greater people-to-people contact, leading to enhanced economic integration and development in this sub-region.
*   **Current Status:** While Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have ratified the agreement, Bhutan has not yet done so due to environmental and livelihood concerns. As a result, the three other nations are proceeding with implementation among themselves, with plans for Bhutan to join at a later date.

**(e) What is the difference between regionalism and regionalization?**

Though related, regionalism and regionalization refer to different processes of regional integration.

*   **Regionalism:** This is a formal, top-down, and political process. It refers to the conscious policies and strategies pursued by the governments of states within a region to create formal regional institutions and agreements. It is an "ideological project" aimed at building a regional community.
    *   **Examples:** The formation of the European Union (EU), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), or the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).

*   **Regionalization:** This is an informal, bottom-up, and primarily economic process. It refers to the growing interconnectedness and interdependence within a region, driven by market forces and private actors. It is the actual increase in cross-border flows of goods, capital, and people, often occurring without formal government agreements.

**The core difference:** Regionalism is the *political will* to integrate, expressed through formal institutions. Regionalization is the *actual process* of integration, driven by economic and social forces.

---

**(f) What is meant by Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) according to the international law of the sea?**

According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a zone of the sea over which a coastal state has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources.

*   **Dimension:** The EEZ extends up to **200 nautical miles (370 km)** from the state's coastal baseline.
*   **Sovereign Rights:** Within its EEZ, the coastal state has sovereign rights for the purpose of **exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing** the natural resources, both living (e.g., fish) and non-living (e.g., oil and natural gas), of the waters, the seabed, and its subsoil.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The state also has jurisdiction over marine scientific research and the protection and preservation of the marine environment within the zone.
*   **Freedom of Other States:** It is important to note that the EEZ is not territorial water. Other states retain the high seas freedoms of navigation and overflight, as well as the right to lay submarine cables and pipelines, within the EEZ.

**(g) What is Dual Track (Track Two) diplomacy?**

Dual Track diplomacy, more commonly known as **Track Two Diplomacy**, is a form of unofficial, non-governmental engagement used to resolve conflicts. It is conducted in parallel with official diplomacy.

*   **Track One Diplomacy:** This is the official, formal diplomacy conducted by government officials, diplomats, and heads of state.
*   **Track Two Diplomacy:** This involves non-official actors such as academics, retired civil and military officials, religious leaders, and civil society representatives. These individuals meet to discuss contentious issues, build trust, and explore potential solutions away from the rigid constraints and political pressures of formal negotiations.

The goal of Track Two diplomacy is not to sign binding agreements but to foster understanding, generate creative new ideas, and create a more favorable environment for official Track One negotiations to succeed. It serves as an important, informal supplement to the formal peace process.

**(h) What is meant by Soft Power?**

Coined by political scientist Joseph Nye, **Soft Power** is the ability of a state to influence the actions of other states and achieve its desired outcomes through attraction and persuasion, rather than through coercion (Hard Power) or payment. It is the power of getting others to *want* what you want.

The sources of a country's soft power are primarily:
1.  **Its Culture:** The global appeal of a country's art, music, films (e.g., Hollywood), food, and language.
2.  **Its Political Values:** The attractiveness of its political ideals, such as democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, when consistently practiced at home and abroad.
3.  **Its Foreign Policies:** When a country's foreign policies are seen as legitimate, moral, and contributing to the global good (e.g., providing development aid, leading on climate action).

Soft power is an indirect and long-term tool of statecraft that helps build goodwill and legitimacy on the world stage.

**(i) Give a brief idea about the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).**

The MDGs and SDGs are two successive global development frameworks adopted by the United Nations.

*   **Millennium Development Goals (MDGs):** Adopted in 2000 for the period up to 2015, the MDGs consisted of **8 goals** with 21 targets. They were primarily focused on social development in developing countries, with goals like eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, reducing child mortality, and combating HIV/AIDS and malaria.

*   **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):** Succeeding the MDGs, the SDGs were adopted in 2015 for the period up to 2030. They are a much broader and more ambitious agenda, consisting of **17 goals** and 169 targets. The SDGs are universal, meaning they apply to all countries (both developed and developing). They integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development: **economic, social, and environmental**, covering issues like climate action, sustainable cities, and peace and justice, in addition to continuing the work of the MDGs.

In short, the SDGs are a more comprehensive, universal, and integrated evolution of the MDGs.

**(j) What were the main decisions of COP 22?**

The 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP 22) to the UNFCCC was held in Marrakech, Morocco, in November 2016. It was dubbed the **"COP of Action"** because its primary task was to begin developing the rules and procedures for implementing the landmark **Paris Agreement**, which had just entered into force.

The main decisions and outcomes were:
1.  **The Marrakech Action Proclamation:** A strong political declaration issued by world leaders reaffirming their irreversible commitment to the Paris Agreement and to tackling climate change, sending a message of global unity.
2.  **Work on the "Paris Rulebook":** A clear work plan and a deadline (2018) were set for finalizing the detailed rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. This included rules on transparency, how countries will report their progress, and how climate finance will be accounted for.
3.  **Launch of the NDC Partnership:** An initiative was launched to help developing countries achieve their climate commitments (Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs) by providing technical and financial support.
4.  **Focus on Adaptation and Finance:** There was a strong emphasis on mobilizing the promised $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing nations and on giving equal importance to climate adaptation measures alongside mitigation.

Of course. Here are the detailed answers for the remaining questions from the provided exam paper.

### **2. Answer any three of the following questions (15 x 3 = 45)**

**(a) Critically review the governance system of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). How might the recently China-proposed and established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) challenge the activities of the ADB? Discuss in the context of the AIIB's formation.**

**Critical Review of ADB's Governance System**

The Asian Development Bank (ADB), established in 1966, has been a cornerstone of development finance in Asia for over half a century. Its governance system is modeled on the Bretton Woods institutions (World Bank and IMF), which has both strengths and significant points of criticism.

*   **Weighted Voting System:** The ADB’s governance is dominated by a weighted voting system where a member's voting power is proportional to its capital subscription. This has resulted in **Japan and the United States** being the two largest shareholders, holding the most significant voting power. Critically, the ADB presidency has, by tradition, always been held by a Japanese national.
*   **Criticism of Governance:**
    1.  **Dominance of Non-Regional Powers:** A major criticism is that the bank's policies and lending priorities are heavily influenced by the interests of its largest shareholders, Japan and the US, rather than being solely driven by the needs of developing Asian nations.
    2.  **Loan Conditionalities:** The ADB, like the World Bank, has often been criticized for attaching stringent policy conditions (conditionalities) to its loans, requiring recipient countries to undertake economic reforms (e.g., privatization, deregulation) that may not always be appropriate for their specific context.
    3.  **Slow and Bureaucratic Processes:** The bank is often perceived as having slow and bureaucratic approval processes, which can delay the implementation of urgently needed infrastructure projects.

**The Challenge from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)**

The formation of the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2016 represents the most significant challenge to the ADB's long-standing dominance in regional development finance.

**Context of AIIB's Formation:**
The AIIB was born out of China's frustration with its own limited influence in the existing international financial institutions, which did not reflect its status as the world's second-largest economy. It was also created to address the massive infrastructure funding gap in Asia, which the ADB and World Bank could not fill alone.

**How AIIB Challenges the ADB:**

1.  **Provides an Alternative Source of Funding:** The AIIB offers developing countries an alternative source for infrastructure financing. This breaks the near-monopoly of the ADB and World Bank, giving countries more options and potentially greater bargaining power when negotiating loan terms.
2.  **Competition on Speed and Efficiency:** The AIIB has positioned itself as a "lean, clean, and green" institution, promising faster and less bureaucratic loan approval processes compared to the ADB. This focus on efficiency is a direct challenge to the perceived slowness of the incumbent institution.
3.  **Different Approach to Conditionalities:** While the AIIB adheres to international standards, it is widely perceived as imposing fewer political and economic policy conditions on its loans. This makes it an attractive option for countries that are wary of the policy prescriptions often attached to ADB and World Bank loans.
4.  **Shifting the Center of Financial Power:** The AIIB's success, with over 100 members including major US allies like the UK, Germany, and Australia, legitimizes a new, China-led multilateral institution. This fundamentally challenges the post-WWII financial architecture and signals a shift in global economic power towards Asia, with China at its center.

In conclusion, the AIIB's presence does not necessarily mean the end of the ADB. Instead, it introduces healthy competition. This competition can compel the ADB to become more responsive, efficient, and equitable in its own governance and operations to remain relevant in a changing geopolitical landscape.

**(b) Discuss the context and current situation of Iran's efforts to acquire nuclear power. What impact will the 2015 agreement with the US and other countries have on Iran's nuclear program? What could be the future of Iran-US relations in light of the newly elected US president's assumption of power?**

**Context of Iran's Nuclear Program**

Iran's nuclear program has been a central issue in international security for decades.

*   **Context:** The program began in the 1950s with US assistance but was halted after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It was revived in the 1980s, and by the early 2000s, the discovery of secret uranium enrichment facilities raised international alarm. The West, particularly the US and Israel, feared the program was a cover for developing nuclear weapons. Iran has consistently maintained that its program is for peaceful purposes, such as electricity generation and medical isotopes.
*   **Current Situation (at the time of the 2015 deal):** Years of crippling international sanctions had severely damaged Iran's economy. The country's nuclear program was advancing, creating a tense standoff with the international community and a constant threat of military conflict.

**Impact of the 2015 Nuclear Deal (JCPOA)**

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed in 2015 between Iran and the P5+1 (US, UK, France, Russia, China + Germany), was a landmark diplomatic achievement.

*   **Impact on Iran's Program:** The deal had a profound impact. In exchange for the lifting of devastating economic sanctions, Iran agreed to:
    *   Drastically reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium.
    *   Limit its level of uranium enrichment to a level suitable for civilian use only.
    *   Decommission thousands of centrifuges.
    *   Allow intrusive, comprehensive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify compliance.
Effectively, the JCPOA blocked all of Iran's potential pathways to a nuclear bomb and pushed its "breakout time" (the time needed to produce enough material for one weapon) from a few months to over a year.

**Future of Iran-US Relations under a New US President**

*The question likely refers to the election of Donald Trump in late 2016.*

The assumption of power by a new US president highly critical of the JCPOA portended a dark future for Iran-US relations and the deal itself.

*   **Shift in US Policy:** The new administration viewed the JCPOA not as a success but as a "terrible deal" that was too lenient on Iran. The stated policy was one of "maximum pressure" rather than diplomatic engagement.
*   **Predicted Future of Relations:**
    1.  **US Withdrawal from the Deal:** It was highly probable that the US would unilaterally withdraw from the JCPOA, which it eventually did in May 2018.
    2.  **Re-imposition of Sanctions:** Following withdrawal, the US would re-impose crippling sanctions, aiming to cripple Iran's economy and force it to negotiate a "better deal."
    3.  **Iran's Reaction:** Faced with renewed sanctions and the loss of economic benefits, Iran would likely cease complying with the deal's restrictions and restart its advanced nuclear enrichment activities.
    4.  **Heightened Tensions:** This cycle of US pressure and Iranian defiance would dismantle the diplomatic breakthrough, dramatically increase regional tensions, and bring the US and Iran back to the brink of military conflict.

In conclusion, the future of Iran-US relations, which had seen a brief window of opportunity with the JCPOA, was set to become far more confrontational and unstable, with the very real risk of the diplomatic process collapsing entirely.

**(d) What is the current state of SAARC as a South Asian development organization? Is it necessary to amend the SAARC Charter to play a stronger role in the future? What kind of changes would make SAARC's role effective? Justify your opinion.**

**Current State of SAARC**

The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), established in 1985, is currently in a state of near-paralysis. While it remains the principal regional organization in South Asia, its effectiveness as a development organization is severely limited.

*   **Key Failures:**
    1.  **India-Pakistan Rivalry:** The persistent political and military hostility between its two largest members, India and Pakistan, has overshadowed all other activities and made meaningful cooperation almost impossible.
    2.  **Lack of Connectivity:** Despite agreements like the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), intra-regional trade remains abysmally low (around 5% of total trade), and physical connectivity is poor.
    3.  **Infrequent Summits:** The requirement for summits to be held annually has not been met for years. The 19th SAARC Summit, scheduled for 2016 in Islamabad, was postponed indefinitely and has not been held since, rendering the organization politically stagnant.

**The Need to Amend the SAARC Charter**

Yes, amending the SAARC Charter is not just necessary but essential if the organization is to be revitalized and play a stronger role. The current charter contains fundamental flaws that have contributed to its ineffectiveness.

**Proposed Changes and Justification:**

1.  **Move Beyond the Unanimity Principle (Article X):**
    *   **The Problem:** The Charter requires that all decisions at all levels be taken on the basis of unanimity. This gives every member, regardless of size, a veto over any proposal, making consensus-building extremely difficult.
    *   **Proposed Change:** Introduce a principle of **"SAARC minus X"** or **qualified majority voting** on projects and programs, particularly in economic and social sectors.
    *   **Justification:** This would allow willing and able member states to move forward with integration projects without being held hostage by the objections of a single member. This principle has worked effectively in other regional blocs like ASEAN.

2.  **Allow Discussion of Bilateral and Contentious Issues (Article X):**
    *   **The Problem:** The Charter explicitly excludes "bilateral and contentious issues" from deliberations. This was intended to prevent the organization from getting bogged down in disputes, but in reality, it has made SAARC unable to address the very issues (like the India-Pakistan conflict) that are the primary obstacles to regional cooperation.
    *   **Proposed Change:** Amend the charter to create a formal mechanism for dialogue and conflict resolution on political and security issues.
    *   **Justification:** A regional organization that cannot discuss the region's most pressing security challenges is bound to be ineffective. Providing a platform for such discussions, even if they don't lead to immediate solutions, would build trust and make SAARC more relevant.

3.  **Strengthen the SAARC Secretariat:**
    *   **The Problem:** The SAARC Secretariat in Kathmandu is relatively weak and under-resourced, with limited authority to initiate proposals or implement decisions.
    *   **Proposed Change:** Empower the Secretariat with greater administrative and financial autonomy and a stronger mandate to drive the regional agenda.
    *   **Justification:** A strengthened, independent Secretariat could act as a neutral and proactive engine for regional integration, similar to the role of the European Commission in the EU.

In conclusion, SAARC's potential as a development organization is immense, but it is crippled by an outdated and flawed charter. Meaningful reform, particularly by moving away from the rigid unanimity and bilateral exclusion clauses, is imperative to break the political deadlock and unlock the benefits of regional cooperation for the people of South Asia.

### **3. After the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh, several unresolved issues remain between Bangladesh and Pakistan. One of these is related to Assets and Liabilities. Recently, Pakistan has expressed some opinions on this matter. As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, what steps can be taken to resolve this issue? Discuss.**

The unresolved issue of the division of assets and liabilities is a significant and long-standing impediment to the full normalization of relations between Bangladesh and Pakistan. As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, my approach to resolving this would be systematic, persistent, and multi-pronged, grounded in international law and diplomatic practice.

**Understanding the Core Problem**

*   **The Claim:** After 1971, Bangladesh, as a successor state to undivided Pakistan, laid a legitimate claim to a share of the assets and liabilities held by Pakistan prior to the Liberation War.
    *   **Assets:** These include a share of foreign currency reserves, gold reserves, government buildings, aircraft of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), ships, military hardware, and other immovable and movable properties.
    *   **Liabilities:** This refers to the external debt incurred by undivided Pakistan. Bangladesh's position is that it should not be responsible for debt that was used for projects located in West Pakistan.
*   **Pakistan's Stance:** Pakistan has consistently refused to acknowledge these claims. Their recent "opinions" likely reiterate their long-held position that there are no pending issues and that all matters were settled in the 1974 Tripartite Agreement (which primarily dealt with prisoners of war and did not address assets and liabilities).

**Diplomatic Strategy for Resolution**

As a Foreign Ministry official, I would recommend the following strategic steps:

1.  **Comprehensive Documentation and Valuation:**
    *   **Action:** The first step is to create an updated and irrefutable official report. We must form a task force of economists, historians, and legal experts to meticulously document all pre-1971 assets and quantify Bangladesh's rightful share based on population, revenue contribution, and other relevant metrics. The value of these assets must be updated to current market prices.
    *   **Purpose:** This provides a concrete, evidence-based foundation for our diplomatic claims, moving the discussion from a political grievance to a quantifiable financial issue.

2.  **Persistent Bilateral Engagement:**
    *   **Action:** The issue must be formally and consistently raised in every bilateral forum with Pakistan, from Foreign Office Consultations to high-level political visits. We should formally request the establishment of a joint commission to specifically address and negotiate the division of assets.
    *   **Purpose:** This prevents Pakistan from claiming the issue is "closed." Continuous pressure ensures it remains on the active bilateral agenda.

3.  **Mobilization in International Forums:**
    *   **Action:** We must internationalize the issue by raising it in relevant global and regional forums.
        *   **United Nations:** We can highlight the issue as a matter of justice and adherence to the principles of state succession under international law.
        *   **Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC):** As members of the OIC, we can seek the support of friendly Muslim countries to act as mediators or to encourage Pakistan to engage in constructive dialogue.
    *   **Purpose:** This builds international pressure on Pakistan and frames the issue not just as a bilateral dispute, but as a matter of international principle and justice.

4.  **Public and Track-Two Diplomacy:**
    *   **Action:** Launch a robust public diplomacy campaign. This involves publishing research papers, holding international seminars, and engaging with international media to build a global narrative around the legitimacy of Bangladesh's claim. We can also encourage Track-Two dialogues involving academics and civil society leaders from both countries to explore potential solutions away from official glare.
    *   **Purpose:** This creates a favorable international environment and builds a constituency of support for our position.

5.  **Linking to Broader Relations (with caution):**
    *   **Action:** While avoiding overtly hostile linkage, it should be made clear through diplomatic channels that the resolution of these legacy issues, including an official apology for the 1971 genocide, is essential for the relationship to achieve its full potential.
    *   **Purpose:** This creates a subtle but clear incentive for Pakistan to address the past in order to build a better future.

In conclusion, resolving the assets and liabilities issue requires a long-term, patient, and methodical diplomatic strategy. It is not merely a financial claim but a matter of national right and historical justice. By combining rigorous documentation, persistent bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, and strategic public engagement, we can continue to advance our legitimate claim and work towards a final, just resolution.
