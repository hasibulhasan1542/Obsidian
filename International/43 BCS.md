### **Question 01: Answer the following questions (4x10=40)**

#### **(a) What is meant by cyber terrorism?**

**Answer:**

**Cyber terrorism** refers to the use of the internet and digital tools by terrorist groups or individuals to conduct violent acts that result in, or threaten, loss of life or significant bodily harm, in order to achieve political or ideological goals through intimidation and coercion. It is the convergence of cyberspace and terrorism.

Key characteristics that distinguish it from general cybercrime are its **motivation** and **impact**. The primary intent is to cause fear, disrupt critical national infrastructure, and create mass panic or societal breakdown.

Examples of cyber terrorism could include:
*   Hacking into and shutting down a nation's **power grid**, causing widespread blackouts.
*   Disrupting a country's **financial system** by attacking its central bank or major stock exchanges.
*   Taking control of a nation's **air traffic control system** to cause collisions.
*   Compromising the control systems of a **dam or a nuclear power plant** to cause a catastrophic disaster.

While large-scale cyber terrorism of this nature remains largely a future threat, the capability to execute such attacks is growing, making it a critical concern for national and international security.

#### **(b) Explain the concept of the 'New International Economic Order'.**

**Answer:**

The **New International Economic Order (NIEO)** was a set of proposals put forward during the 1970s by developing countries through the **Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)** and the **UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)**. It was a political-economic initiative aimed at fundamentally restructuring the global economic system to be more just and equitable for developing nations (often referred to as the "Global South").

The concept was born out of the belief that the existing economic order, established by the Bretton Woods institutions (IMF, World Bank), favored developed countries and perpetuated a system of neo-colonial dependence.

The key demands of the NIEO included:
1.  **Sovereignty over Natural Resources:** The right of developing countries to control their own natural resources and regulate the activities of multinational corporations (MNCs).
2.  **Fair and Stable Commodity Prices:** Establishing mechanisms to stabilize the prices of raw materials, which constituted the bulk of developing country exports.
3.  **Enhanced Development Assistance:** Calling for increased and untied official development aid from developed nations.
4.  **Technology Transfer:** Facilitating the transfer of technology from developed to developing countries on more favorable terms.
5.  **Reforming Global Financial Institutions:** Giving developing countries a greater voice and voting power in the IMF and the World Bank.

Although the NIEO's political momentum faded by the 1980s due to opposition from developed nations and the debt crisis, its core ideas continue to influence contemporary debates on global economic justice, sustainable development, and South-South cooperation.

#### **(d) Describe the concept of postmodernism in the context of international relations.**

**Answer:**

**Postmodernism** in International Relations (IR) is not a single theory that explains how the world works, but rather a critical approach that challenges the foundational assumptions of mainstream IR theories like Realism and Liberalism. It emerged in the 1980s and is primarily concerned with deconstructing traditional concepts and exposing the relationship between knowledge and power.

Key tenets of postmodernism in IR include:
1.  **Skepticism of Grand Narratives (Metanarratives):** Postmodernists are deeply skeptical of overarching theories that claim to provide a universal explanation for international politics. They argue that theories like Realism (which centers on the state and power) are not objective truths, but are themselves "narratives" that serve to legitimize certain power structures.
2.  **Deconstruction of Core Concepts:** They seek to "deconstruct" key IR concepts like 'the state', 'sovereignty', and 'power'. They argue that these concepts are not natural or fixed, but are socially and historically constructed. For example, they would analyze how the idea of the "sovereign state" was created and how it serves to include certain people and exclude others (like refugees).
3.  **The Power of Language and Discourse:** Postmodernists emphasize that language is not a neutral tool for describing reality; it actively shapes it. The way we talk about international events (our "discourse") creates a certain understanding of reality. For instance, labeling a group as "terrorists" versus "freedom fighters" has profound political consequences.
4.  **No Objective Truth:** They reject the idea that there is a single, objective truth about international relations that can be discovered through scientific methods. Instead, they see multiple, competing interpretations and perspectives.

In essence, postmodernism encourages us to question who benefits from the dominant theories and concepts in IR and to be critical of any claim to absolute truth.

#### **(e) What are the main points of the balance of power theory?**

**Answer:**

The **Balance of Power** is a core theory in realist international relations. It posits that national security is enhanced when military capability is distributed in such a way that no single state is strong enough to dominate all others. The main goal is to maintain stability and prevent hegemony in the international system.

The main points and mechanisms of the theory are:
1.  **Core Assumption:** The international system is anarchic (lacks a central authority), and states are rational actors primarily motivated by survival and the pursuit of power.
2.  **Goal of States:** The primary goal is not to maximize power indefinitely, but to prevent any other state from achieving a dominant position (hegemony) that could threaten its own survival.
3.  **Balancing as a Strategy:** When one state or coalition of states becomes too powerful, other states will engage in "balancing" behavior to counter the threat. This can be done in two ways:
    *   **Internal Balancing:** Increasing one's own military capabilities, economic strength, and technological prowess.
    *   **External Balancing:** Forming alliances with other states to create a combined strength that can match or exceed that of the threatening power.
4.  **The Role of Alliances:** Alliances are a key instrument of the balance of power. They are seen as temporary, pragmatic arrangements of convenience, formed to counter a specific threat and dissolved when the threat subsides.
5.  **Stability through Equilibrium:** The theory suggests that this balancing process leads to a state of equilibrium, which, while not permanent, tends to maintain stability and prevent major wars by making aggression too costly for any potential hegemon. The Concert of Europe in the 19th century and the Cold War standoff between the US and USSR are often cited as historical examples.

#### **(h) What is the role of the OIC? Discuss briefly.**

**Answer:**

The **Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)** is the second-largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations, with a membership of 57 states spread over four continents. It was established in 1969 and aims to be the collective voice of the Muslim world (the *Ummah*).

The role of the OIC can be summarized as follows:
1.  **Political and Diplomatic Solidarity:** Its primary role is to promote Islamic solidarity among member states, coordinate cooperation in political, economic, and social fields, and protect the interests of the Muslim world. It frequently issues statements and resolutions on issues affecting Muslims globally, most notably the cause of Palestine.
2.  **Conflict Resolution and Mediation:** The OIC strives to mediate and resolve conflicts between member states, although its success in this area has been limited.
3.  **Economic Cooperation:** It seeks to enhance economic and trade cooperation among its members through subsidiary organs like the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), which provides development financing, and the Islamic Centre for Development of Trade (ICDT).
4.  **Combating Islamophobia:** A key modern role is to collectively combat defamation of Islam and discrimination against Muslims worldwide.
5.  **Protecting Islamic Holy Sites:** One of its founding mandates was to safeguard the Islamic holy places, particularly Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

**Brief Discussion:**
While the OIC serves as an important symbolic platform for Muslim unity, its effectiveness is often hampered by the diverse and often conflicting national interests of its powerful member states (e.g., Saudi Arabia vs. Iran). It has been more successful in cultural and economic cooperation than in resolving major political or security crises.

#### **(j) What is the World Bank? Explain.**

**Answer:**

The **World Bank** is a major international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of low- and middle-income countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects. It is a key component of the Bretton Woods system, which was established in 1944 to rebuild the post-World War II economy. Its official goal is to reduce poverty.

The World Bank is not a single bank but a group of five closely associated institutions:
1.  **International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD):** Provides loans, guarantees, and analytical services to middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries.
2.  **International Development Association (IDA):** Provides long-term, interest-free loans (called "credits") and grants to the world's poorest countries. This is the Bank's "soft loan" window.
3.  **International Finance Corporation (IFC):** Focuses exclusively on the private sector in developing countries, providing investment, advice, and asset management.
4.  **Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA):** Promotes foreign direct investment (FDI) into developing countries by offering political risk insurance (guarantees) to investors and lenders.
5.  **International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID):** Provides international facilities for conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes.

Collectively, the World Bank Group provides financing, policy advice, and technical assistance to developing nations across a wide array of sectors, including infrastructure, health, education, and environmental protection, with the overarching goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

### **Question 02: Answer the following questions (15x3=45)**

#### **(a) What messages does the recent crisis in Sri Lanka carry for the countries of South Asia? Discuss.**

**Answer:**

The 2022 economic collapse in Sri Lanka, which led to sovereign default, severe shortages, and massive political upheaval, carries a series of profound and urgent messages for its South Asian neighbors like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal.

The key messages or lessons are:
1.  **The Danger of Unsustainable Debt:** The foremost lesson is the peril of accumulating unsustainable foreign debt, especially high-interest commercial loans for projects with questionable economic returns. Sri Lanka's "debt-trap," fueled by borrowing for vanity projects like the Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport, serves as a stark warning against prioritizing geopolitical projects over economically viable ones.
2.  **The Critical Importance of Fiscal Discipline:** The crisis was precipitated by populist and reckless fiscal policies. The Gothabaya Rajapaksa government's massive, ill-advised tax cuts in 2019 crippled state revenues, making it impossible to service its debt. This underscores the non-negotiable need for prudent public finance management and a stable revenue base.
3.  **Perils of Unscientific and Populist Policies:** The sudden, overnight ban on chemical fertilizers in 2021, aimed at making Sri Lanka the world's first fully organic nation, was a catastrophic policy failure. It led to a collapse in agricultural output (especially tea and rice), decimated export earnings, and caused severe food shortages. This is a powerful message about the need for evidence-based policymaking over ideological or populist gambles.
4.  **Necessity of Prudent Foreign Exchange Reserve Management:** Sri Lanka's crisis was fundamentally a balance of payments crisis. Its foreign exchange reserves dwindled to almost nothing, leaving it unable to pay for essential imports like fuel, food, and medicine. This highlights the critical need for other South Asian countries to maintain healthy forex reserves to buffer against external shocks.
5.  **Corruption and Poor Governance as a Threat Multiplier:** Endemic corruption, nepotism, and a lack of transparency within the ruling Rajapaksa family exacerbated all the underlying economic vulnerabilities. It eroded public trust and institutional capacity, turning a severe economic crisis into a complete state failure. This message emphasizes that good governance is not a luxury but a prerequisite for economic stability.

In conclusion, the Sri Lankan crisis is a cautionary tale for South Asia, demonstrating how a toxic mix of poor debt management, fiscal indiscipline, populist policies, and weak governance can rapidly unravel decades of development progress.

Of course. Here are the detailed answers for the final questions from the "International Affairs" paper.

### **Question 02 (continued)**

#### **(b) How will Sweden and Finland joining NATO affect the global balance of power? Analyze.**

**Answer:**

The decision by Sweden and Finland to join NATO, abandoning decades of military neutrality in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, represents one of the most significant shifts in the European security landscape since the end of the Cold War. This enlargement will profoundly affect the global balance of power, primarily by strengthening the Western alliance and further isolating Russia.

**Analysis of the Effects:**

1.  **Strategic and Military Strengthening of NATO:**
    *   **Geographical Extension:** Finland shares a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Russia, more than doubling NATO's direct land border with the country. This dramatically alters the strategic calculus in the Baltic Sea region and the High North.
    *   **Enhanced Capabilities:** Both Finland and Sweden bring highly capable, modern, and well-trained militaries to the alliance. Finland has a large, well-equipped reserve army, and Sweden possesses a sophisticated defense industry, advanced fighter jets (the Gripen), and a modern navy with expertise in submarine warfare in the Baltic Sea. This significantly boosts NATO's collective military strength.

2.  **Increased Isolation and Strategic Setback for Russia:**
    *   The expansion is a massive strategic failure for President Putin. One of his stated goals for the war in Ukraine was to halt NATO expansion; instead, he has triggered its most significant enlargement in decades.
    *   The Baltic Sea, a critical maritime route for Russia's navy and commercial shipping, is now almost entirely encircled by NATO members, effectively turning it into a "NATO lake." This severely constrains Russia's naval freedom of maneuver from its Kaliningrad exclave and St. Petersburg.

3.  **Solidification of the Western Bloc:**
    *   The move signals a strong consolidation of the Western-led liberal international order. Two historically neutral, independent-minded European nations have decisively chosen to align with the US-led security bloc, reinforcing the perception of a new ideological and geopolitical divide between Western democracies and autocracies like Russia and China.

4.  **Shifting the Balance in the Arctic:**
    *   With Finland and Sweden's accession, seven of the eight Arctic Council members are now NATO allies (the exception being Russia). This gives the alliance a dominant position in the strategically vital Arctic region, an area of growing competition over resources and new shipping routes, further tilting the regional balance of power against Russia.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, Sweden and Finland joining NATO significantly shifts the global balance of power against Russia. It strengthens NATO's military and strategic posture in Northern Europe, politically isolates Moscow, and solidifies a more unified and powerful Western alliance. This move has locked in a long-term, confrontational security dynamic in Europe and has fundamentally altered the geopolitical map of the continent.

#### **(c) Discuss the impact of climate change on the countries of SAARC.**

**Answer:**

The countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)—Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka—are located in a region that is one of the world's most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The effects are diverse, severe, and pose an existential threat to the region's development, stability, and human security.

**Discussion of Major Impacts:**

1.  **Water Scarcity and Glacial Melt:** The Himalayan glaciers, often called the "water towers of Asia," are the source of the region's major river systems (Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus). Accelerated glacial melt due to rising temperatures initially increases river flows and flood risk, but in the long term, it will lead to drastically reduced water availability. This threatens the water security of hundreds of millions of people in **India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal**, potentially fueling transboundary water conflicts.

2.  **Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Threats:** South Asia has a long and densely populated coastline. Rising sea levels pose a direct existential threat to low-lying nations like the **Maldives**, which could be completely submerged. In **Bangladesh**, it will lead to the inundation of coastal areas, increased soil salinity that destroys agricultural land, and the displacement of millions of "climate refugees." Major coastal cities like Mumbai and Karachi are also at severe risk.

3.  **Increased Frequency and Intensity of Extreme Weather Events:**
    *   **Cyclones:** The Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea are experiencing more frequent and powerful tropical cyclones, devastating coastal communities in **Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan**.
    *   **Floods and Droughts:** Monsoon patterns are becoming more erratic, leading to catastrophic floods in some areas (as seen in Pakistan in 2022) and severe droughts in others, crippling agriculture across the subcontinent.
    *   **Heatwaves:** The region is experiencing record-breaking, life-threatening heatwaves, which have severe impacts on public health, labor productivity, and agriculture.

4.  **Impact on Agriculture and Food Security:** The combination of water scarcity, unpredictable monsoons, soil degradation, and extreme weather is severely undermining agricultural productivity. This threatens the food security of a region that is home to nearly a quarter of the world's population and has high levels of poverty.

5.  **Economic and Social Instability:** The cumulative economic cost of climate change—from damaged infrastructure and lost agricultural output to public health crises—will place an immense strain on the already fragile economies of SAARC nations. The resulting resource competition and mass displacement could exacerbate social tensions and lead to political instability.

In conclusion, climate change is not a future problem for SAARC countries; it is a present and escalating crisis that threatens their very foundations. Addressing it requires urgent and coordinated regional cooperation, a task for which the currently moribund SAARC is ill-equipped.

### **Question 03: Analyze the main features of the foreign policy of Bangladesh. (15)**

**Answer:**

The foreign policy of Bangladesh, since its independence in 1971, has been shaped by its historical struggle, geopolitical location, economic aspirations, and a commitment to international norms. Its core principles are succinctly encapsulated in the constitutional dictum articulated by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman: **"Friendship to all, malice toward none."**

The main features of Bangladesh's foreign policy can be analyzed as follows:

1.  **Principled Stand on Sovereignty and Non-Interference:**
    Rooted in its own liberation struggle against oppression, a cornerstone of Bangladesh's foreign policy is the unwavering respect for national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. It consistently advocates for the peaceful settlement of international disputes in multilateral forums.

2.  **Commitment to Multilateralism and the UN Charter:**
    As a relatively small state, Bangladesh places immense faith in multilateralism and a rules-based international order. It is an active and respected participant in the **United Nations**, being one of the largest troop-contributing countries to UN Peacekeeping operations. This commitment enhances its global standing and soft power.

3.  **Pragmatic Economic Diplomacy:**
    A key driver of modern Bangladeshi foreign policy is the pursuit of economic development. The government actively engages in **"economic diplomacy"** to promote trade, attract foreign direct investment (FDI), secure market access for its exports (especially RMG), and protect the interests of its large expatriate workforce, whose remittances are vital to the economy.

4.  **Balancing Relations with Regional and Global Powers:**
    Geopolitically situated between India and China, and at the crossroads of South and Southeast Asia, Bangladesh pursues a pragmatic and deft balancing act.
    *   **India:** It maintains a deep, historically rooted, and comprehensive partnership with India, its most important neighbor.
    *   **China:** It has also cultivated a strong economic and infrastructure development partnership with China, its largest trading partner.
    *   **Global Powers:** It maintains friendly relations with the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Russia, seeking to engage with all major powers without becoming entangled in their rivalries.

5.  **Advocacy for the Global South and LDCs:**
    Bangladesh has emerged as a prominent voice for the interests of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the broader Global South. It actively champions issues like climate justice, sustainable development goals (SDGs), and reform of the global financial architecture to make it more equitable.

6.  **Humanitarian Leadership:**
    Despite its own constraints, Bangladesh has demonstrated remarkable humanitarian leadership by providing shelter to over one million Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar. This has earned it global praise but has also created immense economic and social challenges, making the pursuit of a sustainable and dignified repatriation of the Rohingya a central foreign policy objective.

In conclusion, Bangladesh's foreign policy is characterized by a blend of principled idealism and pragmatic realism. It navigates the complex global landscape by championing peace and international law while relentlessly pursuing its national interest in economic development and security.
