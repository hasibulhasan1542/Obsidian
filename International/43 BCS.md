### **01. Brief Answers (4x10=40)**

**(a) What is meant by cyber terrorism?**

Cyber terrorism is the use of the internet and computer-based technologies by terrorist groups or individuals to carry out violent acts or cause severe disruption to a nation's critical infrastructure. The primary motive is political or ideological, aiming to create widespread fear, panic, and chaos comparable to traditional terrorism.

Key characteristics include:
*   **Target:** It targets critical national infrastructure such as power grids, air traffic control systems, banking and financial networks, and government databases.
*   **Method:** The methods involve hacking, spreading computer viruses or malware, and launching large-scale denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
*   **Intent:** The goal is not just to disrupt but to cause physical harm, economic collapse, or a loss of public confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens. This political intent distinguishes it from general cybercrime, which is usually motivated by financial gain.

**(b) Explain the concept of the 'New International Economic Order' (NIEO).**

The New International Economic Order (NIEO) was a set of proposals put forward during the 1970s by developing countries, primarily through the Non-Aligned Movement and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). It was a political-economic initiative aimed at fundamentally restructuring the global economic system, which they argued was biased in favor of developed nations (the Global North).

The core demands of the NIEO included:
*   **Sovereignty over Natural Resources:** The right of developing countries to control their own natural resources and regulate the activities of multinational corporations (MNCs).
*   **Fairer Trade Terms:** Securing stable and fair prices for the primary commodities exported by developing countries.
*   **Technology Transfer:** Facilitating the transfer of technology from developed to developing nations on more favorable terms.
*   **Greater Influence:** Increasing the voting power and influence of developing countries in international financial institutions like the World Bank and the IMF.

The NIEO initiative largely failed to be implemented due to strong opposition from developed countries and the economic crises of the 1980s, but its principles continue to influence the discourse on global economic justice.

**(c) Give a brief description of the different levels of diplomacy.**

Diplomacy can be understood as operating on several levels or "tracks," each involving different actors and serving a distinct purpose. The main levels are:

*   **Track One Diplomacy:** This is the official, formal diplomacy conducted by government officials, heads of state, foreign ministers, and professional diplomats. These negotiations are formal, public, and aim to produce legally binding agreements or treaties.
*   **Track Two Diplomacy:** This is unofficial, non-governmental diplomacy conducted by non-state actors such as academics, retired officials, civil society leaders, and other influential individuals. It aims to explore new ideas, build trust, and resolve conflicts away from the rigid constraints and political pressures of official negotiations.
*   **Track 1.5 Diplomacy:** This is a hybrid that brings together official government representatives and non-official experts in an unofficial setting. It allows for creative, off-the-record discussions while ensuring that official perspectives are included, serving as a useful bridge between Track One and Track Two.

**(d) Describe the concept of post-modernism in international relations.**

Post-modernism in International Relations (IR) is not a single theory that explains the world but rather a critical approach that questions the foundational assumptions of traditional IR theories like Realism and Liberalism. It is a method of deconstruction.

Key arguments of post-modernism include:
*   **Rejection of Grand Narratives:** It is skeptical of universal, all-encompassing explanations ("meta-narratives") of international politics. It argues there is no single objective "truth," only competing interpretations.
*   **Focus on Language and Discourse:** It emphasizes that our understanding of the world is constructed through language. Concepts like "sovereignty," "anarchy," or "threat" are not neutral facts but powerful words that shape reality and legitimize certain actions.
*   **Power/Knowledge Relationship:** It argues that knowledge is never neutral; it is always intertwined with power. Powerful states have the ability to define what is considered "knowledge" or "common sense" in IR, reinforcing their own dominance.

---

**(e) What are the main arguments of the balance of power theory?**

The balance of power is a core theory in the realist school of international relations. Its main argument is that international stability is best maintained when military power is distributed among states in such a way that no single state becomes strong enough to dominate all others (i.e., become a hegemon).

The theory's key tenets are:
1.  **Goal is Survival:** The primary goal of states in an anarchic international system is to ensure their own survival and independence.
2.  **Prevention of Hegemony:** States will act, either individually or collectively, to prevent the rise of a dominant power that could threaten their sovereignty.
3.  **Mechanisms for Balancing:** States achieve this balance through two main strategies:
    *   **Internal Balancing:** Increasing one's own military and economic capabilities.
    *   **External Balancing:** Forming alliances with other states to counter a common, powerful threat.

The purpose of the balance of power is not necessarily to create lasting peace, but to create a stable equilibrium that preserves the structure of the state system.

**(f) Briefly describe the concept of the ethical state.**

The concept of an "ethical state" refers to a state that sees its purpose as not just maintaining law and order and providing security (the "minimal state"), but actively promoting the moral and ethical well-being, social justice, and welfare of its citizens.

Key characteristics include:
*   **Promotion of Justice:** It goes beyond basic law enforcement to actively ensure social and economic justice for all its citizens, often through progressive taxation and wealth redistribution.
*   **Commitment to Welfare:** It provides a strong social safety net, including universal access to high-quality education, healthcare, and social security.
*   **Moral Foreign Policy:** In its foreign relations, an ethical state would prioritize human rights, international law, and global cooperation over narrow, self-interested goals.

The Scandinavian countries, with their strong welfare systems and commitment to international cooperation, are often cited as examples that strive toward the ideal of an ethical state.

**(g) What is 'backchannel diplomacy'? Explain.**

Backchannel diplomacy refers to the use of secret, unofficial, or informal communication channels between parties in a conflict, usually governments, that are unable or unwilling to engage in formal, public negotiations. It runs parallel to, or sometimes in the absence of, official diplomatic relations.

The purpose of a backchannel is to:
*   **Explore Possibilities:** Allow parties to test ideas, gauge intentions, and explore the potential for a peace settlement without the risk of public failure or political backlash.
*   **Build Trust:** Create a space for adversaries to build personal relationships and trust away from the public eye.
*   **Convey Sensitive Information:** Transmit sensitive messages or proposals that cannot be communicated through official channels.

A classic example is the secret talks held in Oslo, Norway, between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords.

---

**(h) What is the role of the OIC? Discuss briefly.**

The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is the second-largest intergovernmental organization after the United Nations, consisting of 57 member states. Its primary role is to serve as the **collective voice of the Muslim world**.

Key roles and objectives include:
*   **Promoting Islamic Solidarity:** To strengthen solidarity and cooperation among its member states in economic, social, cultural, and scientific fields.
*   **Safeguarding Common Interests:** To protect and defend the common interests of the Muslim world. A central and long-standing focus has been the support for the Palestinian cause.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** To work towards mediating and resolving conflicts and disputes among member states.
*   **Combating Islamophobia:** To counter defamation of Islam and combat discrimination against Muslims worldwide.

While it is an important diplomatic forum, its effectiveness is often limited by the political divisions and competing national interests of its powerful members.

**(i) What is the Arab League? Explain.**

The Arab League, formally the League of Arab States, is a regional organization of Arab states in and around North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Middle East. Founded in Cairo in 1945, it is one of the world's oldest regional organizations.

*   **Purpose:** Its main goals are to strengthen relations among its member states, coordinate their policies to achieve common goals, safeguard their independence and sovereignty, and mediate disputes between them.
*   **Structure:** It consists of a Council, several committees, and a General Secretariat. Decision-making is based on the principle of unanimity, which means a single member can veto a resolution.
*   **Challenges:** Like many regional bodies, its effectiveness has often been hampered by deep internal divisions, political rivalries between member states, and its inability to enforce its resolutions. The suspension of Syria's membership for over a decade highlighted these internal rifts.

---

**(j) What is the World Bank? Explain.**

The World Bank is a major international financial institution and one of the key pillars of the post-World War II global economic order established at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. It is not a bank in the conventional sense but a unique global partnership dedicated to ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

It is comprised of two main institutions:
1.  **The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD):** It provides loans, guarantees, and advisory services to middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries.
2.  **The International Development Association (IDA):** It provides interest-free loans (called credits) and grants to the world's poorest countries.

The World Bank provides financing and technical assistance to developing countries for a wide range of long-term development projects in areas like infrastructure, education, health, agriculture, and environmental management.

### **02. Answer the following questions (15x3=45)**

**(a) Sri Lanka's recent crisis carries what message for the countries of South Asia? Discuss.**

Sri Lanka's recent economic collapse, the worst in its history since independence, serves as a stark and powerful cautionary tale for the other countries of South Asia. While the specific circumstances of each nation differ, the crisis in Sri Lanka highlights a set of common vulnerabilities and policy missteps that carry crucial messages for its neighbors, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal.

The key messages are:

1.  **The Peril of Unsustainable Debt:** The most direct message is the danger of accumulating unsustainable foreign debt, especially high-interest commercial loans, to finance projects with low economic returns. The crisis demonstrates that while infrastructure is vital, it must be financed prudently. Relying too heavily on non-concessional borrowing to fund vanity projects can lead directly to a sovereign debt crisis when economic conditions sour.

2.  **The Critical Importance of Foreign Exchange Reserves:** Sri Lanka's crisis was triggered by the complete depletion of its foreign exchange reserves, which made it impossible to pay for essential imports like fuel, food, and medicine. This serves as a critical warning about the need for robust and prudent management of foreign reserves. Countries must avoid policies that rapidly drain reserves and maintain a healthy buffer to withstand external shocks.

3.  **The Dangers of Populist Economic Policies:** The Sri Lankan government's decision to implement drastic, un-consulted tax cuts in 2019 severely eroded its revenue base. Similarly, the abrupt and ill-conceived overnight ban on chemical fertilizers devastated the agricultural sector. This is a powerful message that populist, politically motivated economic policies that ignore expert advice can have catastrophic consequences for a nation's economy.

4.  **The Fragility of Over-reliance on a Few Sectors:** Sri Lanka's economy was heavily dependent on tourism and remittances. The COVID-19 pandemic and the 2019 Easter bombings decimated these sectors, exposing the vulnerability of an economy that lacks diversification. This is a crucial lesson for countries like Bangladesh (RMG) and Nepal (tourism and remittances) to aggressively pursue economic diversification to build resilience.

5.  **Good Governance is Non-Negotiable:** The crisis was fundamentally a crisis of governance, characterized by corruption, nepotism, and a lack of transparency and accountability. The concentration of power within a single family and the absence of strong, independent institutions allowed for disastrous policy decisions to go unchecked. This is a universal message for all of South Asia: good governance, strong democratic institutions, and the rule of law are not political luxuries but essential prerequisites for sustainable economic stability.

In conclusion, the tragic collapse of the Sri Lankan economy is a wake-up call for South Asia. It underscores that no country is immune to economic crisis and that fiscal discipline, prudent debt management, economic diversification, and, above all, good governance are essential to ensuring a stable and prosperous future.

**(b) Analyze how Sweden and Finland joining NATO will affect the global balance of power.**

The decisions by Sweden and Finland to abandon decades of military non-alignment and join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) represent one of the most significant shifts in the European security landscape since the end of the Cold War. Triggered directly by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, this expansion of NATO will have profound and lasting effects on the global balance of power.

1.  **Strategic Consolidation of the West and Isolation of Russia:**
    *   Finland's membership doubles NATO's land border with Russia, and both countries bring highly capable, modern militaries into the alliance. This significantly strengthens NATO's northern flank and turns the Baltic Sea into what some analysts have called a "NATO lake," severely constraining the operational freedom of Russia's Baltic Fleet.
    *   This represents a major strategic failure for Russia. President Putin's invasion, intended to weaken NATO and push it back from Russia's borders, has achieved the exact opposite. It has created a more unified, enlarged, and determined Western alliance, leaving Russia more strategically isolated in Europe than at any point since the Cold War.

2.  **Shift in the European Security Order:**
    *   The end of Swedish and Finnish neutrality marks the final demise of the post-Cold War concept of a "gray zone" of neutral states between NATO and Russia. Europe is now more clearly divided into two opposing security blocs. This hardens the security architecture and diminishes the space for neutral, mediating powers.

3.  **Reinforcement of US Leadership and the Transatlantic Alliance:**
    *   The rapid and unified response to the membership bids of Finland and Sweden has reinforced the centrality of US leadership within the transatlantic security framework. The crisis has revitalized NATO's sense of purpose and demonstrated the enduring value of the US security guarantee for European nations, thereby strengthening the cohesion of the Western bloc in the global balance of power.

4.  **Impact on the Global Balance with China:**
    *   While the immediate focus is on Russia, the expansion of NATO has implications for the broader global balance of power involving China. A more unified and assertive West, re-energized by the crisis in Ukraine, is better positioned to coordinate its approach to the long-term strategic challenge posed by China. This development signals to Beijing the strength and resilience of Western alliances, which could act as a deterrent against potential aggression in other parts of the world, such as Taiwan.

In conclusion, the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO is more than just a numerical expansion of the alliance. It is a fundamental shift that has strategically weakened and isolated Russia, consolidated the Western bloc under US leadership, and created a more unified front that will shape not only the security of Europe but also the dynamics of the global balance of power for years to come.

### **03. Analyze the main features of Bangladesh's foreign policy.**

The foreign policy of Bangladesh, since its independence in 1971, has been shaped by its unique history, geopolitical location, and national aspirations. It is a pragmatic and principled policy aimed at safeguarding national sovereignty, promoting economic development, and contributing to global peace. The core features can be analyzed through its guiding principles and practical manifestations.

**1. Guiding Principle: "Friendship to All, Malice Toward None"**
*   **Analysis:** This principle dictates a policy of non-alignment and balanced relations with all countries. It means that Bangladesh seeks to maintain friendly and cooperative ties with all major global and regional powers—including India, China, the United States, and Russia—without being drawn into their conflicts or rivalries. This allows Bangladesh to maximize its diplomatic and economic options and avoid becoming entangled in zero-sum geopolitical games.

**2. Constitutional Mandate for Peace and Cooperation (Article 25)**
The Constitution of Bangladesh provides a clear legal framework for its foreign policy, directing the state to promote international peace, security, and solidarity.
*   **Analysis:** This constitutional commitment is most visibly demonstrated through Bangladesh's role as a leading troop-contributing country to **UN Peacekeeping Operations**. This active participation has earned Bangladesh immense international prestige and has become a key brand identity, positioning the country as a responsible global citizen and a force for peace.

**3. Economic Diplomacy as a Primary Focus**
As a developing nation with ambitious economic goals, a central feature of Bangladesh's foreign policy is economic diplomacy.
*   **Analysis:** The primary objective of its diplomatic missions abroad is to promote the "Made in Bangladesh" brand, attract foreign direct investment (FDI), secure favorable market access for its exports (especially RMG), and ensure the welfare of its large diaspora community and the continued flow of remittances. The pursuit of economic interests often guides its diplomatic engagements.

**4. Commitment to Multilateralism and a Rules-Based Order**
As a smaller state, Bangladesh's security and prosperity depend heavily on a stable, rules-based international system.
*   **Analysis:** Bangladesh is a strong proponent of the United Nations and other multilateral institutions. It actively participates in regional forums like SAARC, BIMSTEC, and the OIC. Its successful resolution of maritime boundary disputes with both India and Myanmar through international arbitration (the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea) is a powerful testament to its faith in international law over military might.

**5. Strategic Balancing in a Complex Neighborhood**
Geographically positioned between India and China, two regional giants and rivals, a key feature of Bangladesh's foreign policy is the pragmatic art of strategic balancing.
*   **Analysis:** Bangladesh has successfully cultivated a deep strategic partnership with India, its most important neighbor, while simultaneously developing a strong economic and defense relationship with China, its largest trading partner and a key source of infrastructure investment. Navigating these two relationships without alienating either is a masterclass in pragmatic diplomacy and is essential for maintaining its strategic autonomy.

In conclusion, the foreign policy of Bangladesh is characterized by a blend of idealism and pragmatism. It is founded on the principled pursuit of peace and cooperation, but it is driven by the pragmatic needs of economic development and the necessity of balancing relationships in a complex geopolitical environment.
