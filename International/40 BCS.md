### **Question 01: Answer the following questions: (4x10=40)**

#### **(a) What is meant by climate refugee?**

**Answer:**
A **climate refugee**, also known as a climate migrant or environmental refugee, is a person who is forced to leave their home and community due to the sudden or long-term adverse effects of climate change. Unlike traditional refugees who flee conflict or persecution, climate refugees are displaced by environmental factors.

The primary drivers of climate-induced displacement include:
*   **Sea-Level Rise:** Rising sea levels inundate low-lying coastal areas and small island nations, forcing entire communities to relocate. Bangladesh and the Maldives are prime examples of countries facing this threat.
*   **Extreme Weather Events:** Increased frequency and intensity of events like hurricanes, cyclones, floods, and wildfires destroy homes and livelihoods, leading to immediate displacement.
*   **Drought and Desertification:** Prolonged droughts turn fertile land into desert, making agriculture impossible and forcing people to migrate in search of water and food. This is a significant issue in the Sahel region of Africa.
*   **Water Scarcity:** Melting glaciers and changing rainfall patterns threaten the water supply for millions, compelling them to move.

Currently, climate refugees are **not formally recognized** under international law or the **1951 Refugee Convention**, which means they do not have the same legal protections as traditional refugees. However, the international community is increasingly recognizing the scale of the problem, with the UNHCR and other bodies advocating for a legal framework to protect this growing population.

#### **(b) Discuss briefly the Fourth Industrial Revolution.**

**Answer:**
The **Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)** represents the current and developing environment in which disruptive technologies and trends are changing the way we live, work, and relate to one another. It is characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.

Unlike the previous industrial revolutions which were driven by steam (1st), electricity (2nd), and computing (3rd), the 4IR is defined by its **velocity, scope, and systems impact**.

Key technologies driving the 4IR include:
1.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning:** Systems that can learn, reason, and make decisions, automating tasks previously done by humans.
2.  **Internet of Things (IoT):** The network of interconnected physical devices embedded with sensors and software that can collect and exchange data (e.g., smart homes, smart cities).
3.  **Big Data:** The ability to process and analyze massive datasets to identify patterns and make predictions.
4.  **Robotics and Automation:** Advanced robots capable of performing complex tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare.
5.  **Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering:** Advances in fields like CRISPR gene editing that are revolutionizing medicine and agriculture.
6.  **Blockchain:** A secure, decentralized digital ledger technology that is transforming finance and supply chain management.

The 4IR is poised to fundamentally reshape global industries, economies, and societies, creating immense opportunities for innovation and efficiency while also posing significant challenges related to job displacement, inequality, and ethical governance.

#### **(d) Mention the nature of international terrorism.**

**Answer:**
The nature of **international terrorism** has evolved significantly over the past few decades, moving from hierarchical, state-sponsored groups to a more decentralized, ideologically-driven, and technologically-savvy phenomenon.

Key features of its current nature include:
1.  **Globalized and Transnational Networks:** Modern terrorist groups, such as **Al-Qaeda** and the **Islamic State (ISIS)**, operate as global networks with affiliates and sympathizers in many countries. They are not confined by national borders.
2.  **Ideological Motivation:** Contemporary international terrorism is often driven by a radical, transnational religious or political ideology (e.g., Salafi-jihadism) that seeks to create a new global order, rather than achieving limited nationalist goals.
3.  **Decentralization and "Lone Wolf" Attacks:** Instead of centrally-planned, large-scale attacks, there has been a shift towards a more decentralized model. Terrorist groups now often inspire so-called "lone wolf" attackers—individuals radicalized online—to carry out smaller-scale but equally deadly attacks in their home countries, making them much harder to detect and prevent.
4.  **Sophisticated Use of Technology:** Terrorist groups masterfully use the internet and social media for propaganda, recruitment, radicalization, and communication. Encrypted messaging apps are used for operational planning, while high-quality videos and online magazines are produced to spread their ideology globally.
5.  **Targeting of Civilians (Soft Targets):** A hallmark of modern international terrorism is the deliberate targeting of civilians in public places ("soft targets") to maximize fear, cause mass casualties, and generate widespread media attention. The goal is psychological impact as much as physical destruction.

#### **(e) What is meant by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)?**

**Answer:**
The **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**, sometimes referred to as the New Silk Road, is a massive and ambitious global infrastructure development strategy adopted by the Chinese government in 2013. It is the centerpiece of President Xi Jinping's foreign policy.

The BRI consists of two main components:
1.  **The Silk Road Economic Belt (The "Belt"):** This refers to a series of overland corridors connecting China with Europe through Central Asia and the Middle East. It involves building roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, and other infrastructure projects.
2.  **The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (The "Road"):** This is a sea-based route connecting China's coastal regions with Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe through a network of seaports and maritime infrastructure.

**Objectives:**
The stated goal of the BRI is to enhance connectivity and promote economic cooperation and trade between China and the rest of the world. However, it also has significant geopolitical objectives:
*   **Expanding China's Economic and Political Influence:** By financing and building critical infrastructure across the globe, China increases its economic leverage and political influence over participating countries.
*   **Creating New Markets:** The BRI helps create new markets for Chinese goods and construction companies.
*   **Securing Energy and Trade Routes:** It aims to secure China's access to energy resources and create alternative trade routes that are not dependent on sea lanes controlled by the United States.

The BRI has been met with both enthusiasm from participating countries seeking infrastructure investment and criticism from others (notably the US) who view it as a tool for "debt-trap diplomacy" and a challenge to the existing international order.

#### **(g) What is the difference between a fragile state and a failed state?**

**Answer:**
While both terms describe states with severe weaknesses, "fragile state" and "failed state" represent different points on a spectrum of state incapacity.

**Fragile State:**
A **fragile state** is a country characterized by weak state capacity and/or weak state legitimacy, leaving its citizens vulnerable to a range of shocks. The state is still functioning but is performing its core functions poorly and is at high risk of conflict and collapse.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   Inability to provide basic public services (e.g., security, healthcare, education) to a significant portion of its population.
    *   Weak control over its territory.
    *   High levels of corruption and political instability.
    *   Severe economic problems and social tensions.
*   **Example:** Haiti or Somalia in certain periods could be considered fragile states. They have a government, but its authority is weak and its ability to govern is severely limited.

**Failed State:**
A **failed state** is a more extreme condition where the machinery of the state has completely collapsed. The government has lost physical control of its territory and is unable to provide even the most basic services or guarantee security.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   A complete breakdown of law and order.
    *   The government has no effective territorial control and cannot project its authority.
    *   Widespread violence, often from non-state actors like warlords or militias.
    *   Cessation of public services.
*   **Example:** Somalia in the early 1990s is the classic textbook example of a failed state, where there was no functioning central government.

In essence, a **fragile state is a state in crisis and at risk of collapse**, while a **failed state is one that has already collapsed**. Fragility is a condition of vulnerability; failure is a condition of complete breakdown.

#### **(j) Briefly mention the importance of CEDAW.**

**Answer:**
**CEDAW**, the **Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women**, is a landmark international human rights treaty adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1979. It is often described as the international bill of rights for women.

Its importance is profound for several reasons:
1.  **Comprehensive Definition of Discrimination:** CEDAW is the first international treaty to provide a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women and to set out an agenda for national action to end such discrimination.
2.  **Sets International Standards:** It establishes a universal standard for women's rights in all spheres of life, including political, economic, social, cultural, and civil. It obligates state parties to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination and ensure women's equality.
3.  **Holistic Approach:** The convention addresses not only overt legal discrimination but also the role of culture, tradition, and stereotypes in perpetuating inequality. It calls for changes in social and cultural patterns to overcome prejudice.
4.  **Accountability Mechanism:** It creates a monitoring body, the **Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women**, to which state parties must submit regular reports on their progress in implementing the convention. This creates a mechanism for international accountability.

CEDAW has been a powerful tool for women's rights activists worldwide, providing a legal and moral framework to advocate for changes in national laws and policies to advance gender equality.

#### **(l) What is the importance of the theory of functionalism in the context of regional cooperation?**

**Answer:**
**Functionalism** is a theory of international integration that argues that cooperation between states is best achieved by starting with collaboration on specific, non-controversial, functional, or technical issues rather than high-stakes political issues. The core idea is that as states work together to solve common problems in areas like health, trade, or transport, the benefits of this cooperation will "spill over" into more politically sensitive areas, gradually building trust and paving the way for deeper political integration.

**Importance in Regional Cooperation:**
Functionalism provides the theoretical foundation for many successful regional cooperation initiatives.
1.  **A Practical Path to Integration:** It offers a pragmatic and gradualist approach to building cooperation. Instead of starting with difficult political questions like sovereignty, it begins with "low politics"—technical problems that governments have a shared interest in solving.
2.  **Building Trust:** Successful cooperation on functional issues helps to build habits of collaboration and trust among technocrats and officials from different countries, which can then facilitate cooperation on more contentious political issues.
3.  **The European Union as a Prime Example:** The European Union is the classic example of functionalism in action. It began in the 1950s as the **European Coal and Steel Community**, a purely functional organization to manage these two key industries. The success of this economic cooperation gradually "spilled over," leading to the creation of a common market (the European Economic Community) and eventually a full-fledged political and monetary union (the EU).

The theory's importance lies in its demonstration that by focusing on shared needs and technical problem-solving, regional cooperation can be built from the ground up, ultimately leading to a more peaceful and integrated community of states.

### **Question 02**

#### **(a) What messages does the recent crisis in Sri Lanka carry for the countries of South Asia? Discuss.**

(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)

**Answer:**  
The 2022 economic collapse in Sri Lanka carries several urgent messages for its South Asian neighbors.

1. **The Danger of Unsustainable Debt:** It serves as a stark warning against accumulating unsustainable foreign debt, especially high-interest commercial loans for projects with poor economic returns.
    
2. **The Critical Importance of Fiscal Discipline:** The crisis was precipitated by populist and reckless fiscal policies, particularly massive tax cuts that crippled state revenues. This underscores the need for prudent public finance management.
    
3. **Perils of Unscientific Policies:** The sudden, ill-advised ban on chemical fertilizers, which led to a collapse in agricultural output, is a powerful message about the need for evidence-based policymaking over ideological gambles.
    
4. **Prudent Foreign Exchange Reserve Management:** The crisis was fundamentally a balance of payments crisis. It highlights the critical need for other South Asian countries to maintain healthy forex reserves to buffer against external shocks.
    
5. **Corruption and Poor Governance as a Threat Multiplier:** Endemic corruption and weak governance exacerbated all underlying economic vulnerabilities, turning a severe economic crisis into a complete state failure.

#### **(b) How will Sweden and Finland joining NATO affect the global balance of power? Analyze.**

(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)

**Answer:**  
The accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO significantly shifts the global balance of power, primarily by strengthening the Western alliance and strategically weakening Russia.

**Analysis:**

1. **Strategic Strengthening of NATO:**
    
    - **Geographical Extension:** Finland's 1,340-km border with Russia more than doubles NATO's direct land border with the country.
        
    - **Enhanced Capabilities:** Both nations bring modern, capable militaries, significantly boosting NATO's collective strength in the Baltic Sea and the Arctic.
        
2. **Increased Isolation of Russia:**
    
    - The expansion is a massive strategic failure for Russia, as one of its stated war aims was to halt NATO expansion.
        
    - The Baltic Sea is now almost entirely encircled by NATO members, severely constraining Russia's naval freedom of maneuver.
        
3. **Solidification of the Western Bloc:**
    
    - The move signals a strong consolidation of the Western-led liberal international order, reinforcing a new geopolitical divide between Western democracies and autocracies.
        
4. **Shifting the Balance in the Arctic:**
    
    - With their accession, seven of the eight Arctic Council members are now NATO allies, giving the alliance a dominant position in this strategically vital region.
        

This enlargement has locked in a long-term, confrontational security dynamic in Europe and has fundamentally strengthened the Western position in the global balance of power.

#### **(c) Discuss the impact of climate change on the countries of SAARC.**

(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)

**Answer:**  
The countries of the SAARC region are exceptionally vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which pose an existential threat to their development and security.

**Major Impacts:**

1. **Water Scarcity and Glacial Melt:** The Himalayan glaciers, the source of the region's major rivers, are melting at an accelerated rate. This will lead to long-term water scarcity for hundreds of millions in **India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal**, potentially fueling transboundary water conflicts.
    
2. **Sea-Level Rise:** Rising sea levels pose a direct existential threat to low-lying nations like the **Maldives** and will inundate vast coastal areas of **Bangladesh**, causing mass displacement and loss of agricultural land due to salinity.
    
3. **Extreme Weather Events:** The region is experiencing more frequent and powerful **cyclones** (in Bangladesh, India), catastrophic **floods** (in Pakistan), and severe **droughts** and **heatwaves**, crippling agriculture and public health.
    
4. **Impact on Food Security:** The combination of these factors is severely undermining agricultural productivity, threatening the food security of a region home to nearly a quarter of the world's population.
    
5. **Economic and Social Instability:** The immense economic cost of climate change and the resulting resource competition and mass displacement could exacerbate social tensions and lead to political instability across the region.

### **Question 03: Analyze the main features of the foreign policy of Bangladesh.** (Marks: 15)

(This question is a duplicate from another paper. The answer is provided again for completeness.)

**Answer:**  
The foreign policy of Bangladesh is guided by the constitutional principle of **"Friendship to all, malice toward none."** This has translated into a pragmatic, non-aligned, and peace-centric approach to international relations.

The main features are:

1. **Principled Stand on Sovereignty and Non-Interference:** Rooted in its own liberation struggle, Bangladesh champions respect for national sovereignty and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.
    
2. **Commitment to Multilateralism:** As a relatively small state, Bangladesh places immense faith in a rules-based international order and is a strong supporter of the United Nations. It is one of the world's largest contributors to UN Peacekeeping operations.
    
3. **Pragmatic Economic Diplomacy:** The primary driver of its foreign policy is the pursuit of national economic development. This involves promoting trade, attracting foreign investment, and securing market access for its exports.
    
4. **Strategic Balancing:** Bangladesh maintains a deft balancing act between regional and global powers. It nurtures a deep, historical partnership with **India** while also cultivating a strong economic relationship with **China**. It also maintains friendly relations with the US, EU, Japan, and Russia, avoiding entanglement in great power rivalries.
    
5. **Advocacy for the Global South:** Bangladesh is a prominent voice for the interests of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), championing issues like climate justice and sustainable development.
    
6. **Humanitarian Leadership:** By providing shelter to over one million Rohingya refugees, Bangladesh has demonstrated remarkable humanitarian leadership, making the pursuit of their safe and dignified repatriation a central foreign policy objective.

### **Question 03**

**Original:** রোহিঙ্গা সংকট মোকাবেলায় বাংলাদেশের গৃহীত নীতি ও পদক্ষেপ সারা বিশ্বে প্রশংসিত হচ্ছে এবং দেশের জন্য অনেক সুফল বয়ে আনছে। কিন্তু মিয়ানমার সরকারের আচরণের কোন পরিবর্তন ঘটছে না। রোহিঙ্গাদের ফিরিয়ে নেয়ার ব্যাপারে কোন কার্যকর ভূমিকা রাখছে না। এ পরিস্থিতিতে জাতিসংঘের নিরাপত্তা পরিষদে রোহিঙ্গা বিষয়ে একটি উন্মুক্ত আলোচনায় বাংলাদেশকে আমন্ত্রণ জানানো হয়েছে। বাংলাদেশের পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রী এই আলোচনায় অংশ নেবেন। এ বিষয়ে বাংলাদেশ সরকারের জন্য একটি নীতিপত্র (policy brief) তৈরী করুন।

**Translation:** The policies and steps taken by Bangladesh to deal with the Rohingya crisis are being praised all over the world and are bringing many benefits to the country. But there is no change in the behavior of the Myanmar government. It is not playing any effective role in taking back the Rohingya. In this situation, Bangladesh has been invited to an open discussion on the Rohingya issue at the United Nations Security Council. The Foreign Minister of Bangladesh will participate in this discussion. Prepare a policy brief for the Government of Bangladesh on this matter.

**Answer:**

### **Policy Brief for the Government of Bangladesh**

**To:** The Honourable Foreign Minister, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh
**From:** [Your Title/Department]
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Subject:** **A Strategic Framework for Bangladesh's Address to the UN Security Council on the Rohingya Crisis: Shifting from Burden-Sharing to Responsibility-Sharing**

**1. Introduction and Core Objective:**

This policy brief outlines a strategic approach for Bangladesh's address to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). For over five years, Bangladesh has borne an immense humanitarian burden by providing shelter to over 1.1 million Rohingya refugees. Despite our government's good-faith efforts and bilateral agreements, the lack of political will from Myanmar, compounded by its internal instability following the 2021 coup, has created a complete stalemate in the repatriation process. The core objective of our address must be to **reframe the international narrative from merely managing a crisis within Bangladesh to compelling concrete international action to resolve its root causes within Myanmar.**

**2. Key Messages for the UNSC Address:**

Our statement should be structured around three pillars: acknowledging our humanitarian role, highlighting the growing security threats, and demanding decisive UNSC action.

**Pillar I: Acknowledging Bangladesh's Humanitarian Commitment (The Moral High Ground)**
*   **Reiterate Generosity:** Begin by reminding the Council of Bangladesh's immense humanitarian generosity, undertaken despite our own developmental challenges. Emphasize that we have saved a population from a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing," upholding our commitment to humanity.
*   **Highlight the Cost:** Present clear data on the immense and unsustainable costs borne by Bangladesh:
    *   **Economic Cost:** The annual cost of hosting the Rohingya is over **$1.2 billion**. This diverts critical resources from our own development priorities.
    *   **Environmental Cost:** Cite the massive deforestation (over **6,800 acres of forest land**) and the severe degradation of the ecosystem in Cox's Bazar.
    *   **Social Cost:** Detail the growing social tensions between the host community and the refugees over resources, jobs, and cultural differences.

**Pillar II: Highlighting the Escalating Security Threats (The Imperative for Action)**
This is the most critical part of the address. We must shift the focus from a "humanitarian crisis" to a "threat to regional peace and security," which falls directly under the UNSC's mandate (Chapter VII of the UN Charter).
*   **Transnational Crime:** Present evidence that the protracted stay has turned the camps into a hotbed for transnational crime, including **drug trafficking (especially yaba), human trafficking, and arms smuggling**.
*   **Rise of Extremism:** Warn of the growing risk of radicalization. A generation of Rohingya youth with no hope, education, or future is highly vulnerable to recruitment by extremist and insurgent groups. This is not just a threat to Bangladesh but to the entire region.
*   **Regional Instability:** Argue that the conflict within Myanmar is spilling over, and the Rohingya crisis is a key destabilizing factor that could draw in regional powers and exacerbate geopolitical tensions.

**Pillar III: Demanding Concrete UNSC Action (The Call for Responsibility)**
Having established the security threat, we must move beyond calls for aid and demand specific, binding actions from the Council.
*   **UNSC Resolution:** Call for a new, strong, and binding UNSC resolution on Myanmar that includes:
    *   A clear timeline and verifiable benchmarks for creating conditions conducive to the **safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable repatriation** of the Rohingya.
    *   The establishment of internationally monitored **"safe zones"** in the Rakhine State.
    *   An immediate and monitored **ceasefire** in Rakhine State.
*   **Targeted Sanctions and Arms Embargo:** Demand that the UNSC impose a global, comprehensive arms embargo on the Myanmar military junta and implement targeted sanctions against its leaders and military-owned enterprises to cut off their sources of revenue and weapons.
*   **Referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC):** Urge the UNSC to refer the entire situation in Myanmar to the ICC to ensure that the architects of the Rohingya genocide are held accountable. Argue that justice and accountability are prerequisites for a sustainable solution.

**3. Conclusion:**

The Foreign Minister should conclude by stating that Bangladesh has done its part and that the patience of its people is wearing thin. The international community, and specifically the Security Council, can no longer treat this as Bangladesh's problem to manage. It is a threat to international peace and security that originates in Myanmar, and the Council must now assume its responsibility to solve it at its source. The burden must shift to responsibility, and the time for decisive action is now.
