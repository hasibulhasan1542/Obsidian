### **01. Answer the following questions (4x10=40)**

**(a) What is meant by a climate refugee?**

A climate refugee (or more accurately, a climate-displaced person) is a person forced to leave their home and community due to the adverse effects of sudden or long-term changes in their local environment caused by climate change.

These changes include:
*   **Sea-level rise:** Which leads to the permanent inundation of coastal areas.
*   **Extreme weather events:** Such as more frequent and intense hurricanes, floods, and wildfires.
*   **Drought and desertification:** Which destroy agricultural livelihoods and create water scarcity.

Critically, the term "climate refugee" has no legal basis under international law. The 1951 Refugee Convention defines a refugee as someone fleeing persecution, and it does not cover those displaced by environmental factors. This leaves climate-displaced persons in a state of legal limbo, without formal international protection.

**(b) Briefly discuss the Fourth Industrial Revolution.**

The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is the current and developing era of technological advancement characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres. Coined by Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum, it is a new chapter in human development.

Key characteristics include:
*   **Core Technologies:** It is driven by breakthroughs in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, genetic engineering, and quantum computing.
*   **Fusion of Technologies:** Unlike previous revolutions, the 4IR is defined by the convergence and interaction of different technologies, creating unprecedented new capabilities.
*   **Velocity and Scope:** It is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace, and its impact is disrupting almost every industry in every country, transforming entire systems of production, management, and governance.

**(c) Briefly discuss the blue economy.**

The blue economy refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of the ocean ecosystem. It is an economic model that seeks to balance economic activity with the long-term capacity of marine ecosystems.

The key sectors of the blue economy include:
*   Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture
*   Marine renewable energy (offshore wind, wave, and tidal power)
*   Maritime transport and shipbuilding
*   Coastal tourism
*   Marine biotechnology and bioprospecting

The core principle is sustainability. It moves beyond viewing the ocean simply as a domain for exploitation and instead promotes it as a space for sustainable development, ensuring that its resources are managed for the benefit of both current and future generations. For a country like Bangladesh with a vast maritime area, the blue economy represents a major frontier for future growth.

**(d) Mention the nature of international terrorism.**

International terrorism refers to acts of politically motivated violence against non-combatant targets, where the perpetrators, victims, or targets cross national borders, or the act is intended to influence the policies of a foreign government.

The nature of contemporary international terrorism is characterized by:
*   **Transnational Networks:** Modern terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda operate as decentralized, global networks rather than hierarchical organizations tied to a single state.
*   **Ideological Motivation:** Many contemporary groups are driven by radical religious or ideological extremism rather than purely nationalist or separatist goals.
*   **Use of Modern Technology:** They expertly use the internet and social media for global recruitment, propaganda, fundraising, and planning attacks.
*   **Indiscriminate Mass Casualties:** The goal is often to inflict the maximum number of casualties to create widespread fear and psychological impact, rather than targeting specific symbolic buildings or individuals.

**(e) What is meant by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)?**

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a massive and ambitious global infrastructure development strategy and foreign policy initiative launched by the Chinese government in 2013. It is considered the centerpiece of President Xi Jinping's foreign policy.

The BRI consists of two main components:
1.  **The Silk Road Economic Belt:** A network of overland corridors (roads, railways, pipelines) connecting China to Europe via Central Asia and the Middle East.
2.  **The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road:** A sea route connecting China's coastal regions to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Europe through a series of ports and maritime infrastructure.

The initiative aims to enhance connectivity, promote trade, and foster economic integration across Asia, Africa, and Europe, ultimately increasing China's economic and geopolitical influence on the world stage.

**(f) What is the importance of public diplomacy in foreign policy? Briefly explain.**

Public diplomacy is the process by which a government communicates with and influences foreign publics to advance its national interests and foreign policy goals. Its importance lies in its ability to shape the international environment in which foreign policy operates.

Key points of its importance include:
*   **Building Soft Power:** It helps create a positive national image and cultural attraction, which makes other countries more likely to cooperate.
*   **Winning Hearts and Minds:** It fosters understanding and support for a country's policies among foreign populations, which can put pressure on their governments.
*   **Countering Misinformation:** It provides a direct channel to correct negative stereotypes and counter hostile propaganda.
*   **Long-Term Relationship Building:** Through cultural and educational exchanges (e.g., the Fulbright Program), it builds lasting relationships and networks that support foreign policy objectives.

---

**(g) What is the difference between a fragile state and a failed state?**

The difference between a fragile state and a failed state lies on a spectrum of state capacity and control.

*   **Fragile State:** A fragile state is a state whose government has severely weakened capacity to perform the basic functions of governing, such as providing security, justice, and essential public services. The state's institutions are weak and its legitimacy is low, putting it at high risk of collapse and conflict. However, a central government, however weak, still exists.

*   **Failed State:** A failed state is a state that has completely lost its ability to govern and its monopoly on the legitimate use of force over its territory. The central government has collapsed, and a vacuum of authority emerges, often filled by warlords, militias, or other non-state actors. It can no longer provide basic security or services to its citizens.

**The key difference:** A fragile state is on the brink of collapse, while a failed state has already collapsed. Fragility is a condition of weakness; failure is a condition of total breakdown.

**(h) Briefly discuss the reasons for the South China Sea dispute.**

The South China Sea dispute is a complex web of overlapping territorial and maritime claims by several countries. The primary reasons for the dispute are:

1.  **Territorial Claims:** China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan have competing claims over islands (like the Spratlys and Paracels), reefs, and rocks in the sea, based on conflicting historical, geographic, and legal arguments. China's expansive "nine-dash line" claim conflicts with the claims of all other parties.
2.  **Economic Resources:** The region is believed to hold significant reserves of oil and natural gas and contains some of the world's most productive fishing grounds, making control over it economically vital.
3.  **Strategic Waterway:** It is one of the busiest and most important shipping lanes in the world, with trillions of dollars in global trade passing through it annually. Control over these sea lanes offers immense strategic leverage.
4.  **Geopolitical Rivalry:** The sea has become a major arena for the strategic competition between China, which seeks regional dominance, and the United States, which aims to uphold freedom of navigation and support its regional allies.

---

**(i) Briefly discuss the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization.**

The Dispute Settlement System (DSS) is the central pillar of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and is considered its most important contribution to the stability of the global economy. It is a formal, rule-based mechanism for member states to resolve trade conflicts.

Key features include:
*   **Rule-Based and Binding:** Disputes are adjudicated based on the agreed-upon WTO rules, not on the relative economic or political power of the countries. The rulings are binding on the parties involved.
*   **Prevents Unilateral Action:** It provides a multilateral forum for resolving grievances, preventing countries from taking unilateral retaliatory measures (like trade wars).
*   **Authorization of Retaliation:** If a country found to be in violation does not comply with the ruling, the Dispute Settlement Body can authorize the winning country to impose retaliatory trade sanctions.

The system ensures that trade flows more smoothly and predictably by providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system.

---

**(j) Briefly mention the importance of CEDAW.**

CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women) is a landmark international treaty adopted by the UN in 1979, often described as an international bill of rights for women. Its importance is immense:

1.  **Defines Discrimination:** It is the first international instrument to comprehensively define discrimination against women and set an agenda for national action to end such discrimination.
2.  **Sets Global Norms:** It establishes universal standards for women's rights in all fields—civil, political, economic, social, and cultural—creating a powerful normative framework for gender equality.
3.  **Creates Accountability:** It establishes a monitoring body (the CEDAW Committee) that reviews the progress of state parties, holding governments accountable for their obligations to protect and promote women's rights.
4.  **Drives Legal Reform:** It has been a catalyst for legal and constitutional reforms in countries around the world, helping to repeal discriminatory laws and promote gender equality.

---

**(k) Briefly discuss the nature of the transatlantic relationship.**

The transatlantic relationship refers to the deep, multifaceted relationship between the countries of North America (primarily the United States and Canada) and Europe. Its nature is defined by three core pillars:

1.  **Security Alliance:** The bedrock of the relationship is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a collective defense alliance forged during the Cold War that commits members to mutual defense.
2.  **Economic Interdependence:** The US and the European Union together form the largest and wealthiest economic relationship in the world, with massive flows of trade and investment in both directions.
3.  **Shared Values:** The relationship is historically grounded in a shared commitment to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and free-market principles.

While historically strong, the nature of the relationship has become more complex, facing challenges over trade disputes, security burden-sharing, and differing approaches to global issues like China, requiring constant recalibration and dialogue.

**(l) What is the importance of the theory of functionalism in regional cooperation?**

Functionalism is a theory of international integration that holds that cooperation should begin in specific, non-political, "functional" sectors where states have a common interest (e.g., trade, transport, health). Its importance lies in its pragmatic approach to building peace and cooperation.

*   **Bypassing Political Hostility:** Its primary importance is that it offers a way to build trust and cooperation between states, even those with deep political rivalries, by focusing on technical problems rather than high-stakes political issues.
*   **The "Spillover" Effect:** The theory's core mechanism is "spillover." It posits that successful cooperation in one functional area will build momentum and create incentives to cooperate in other, related areas. This gradually entangles states in a web of interdependence, making war less likely and eventually "spilling over" into political integration.
*   **A Proven Model:** Its greatest importance is historical; functionalism provided the intellectual foundation for the European Union, which began as the purely functional European Coal and Steel Community and gradually evolved into the world's most integrated political and economic bloc.

### **2. Answer any three of the following questions (15x3=45)**

**(a) Describe the impact of the ongoing trade war between the United States and China on the international market and the world economy.**

The ongoing trade war between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, has sent significant shockwaves through the international market and the global economy. This conflict, characterized by the reciprocal imposition of high tariffs and other trade barriers, has created a climate of uncertainty and disruption with far-reaching consequences.

**Impact on the International Market:**

1.  **Disruption of Global Supply Chains:** For decades, multinational corporations built complex global supply chains centered on China's manufacturing prowess. The trade war has forced a massive and costly re-evaluation of these chains. Companies are now diversifying production to other countries like Vietnam, Mexico, and Bangladesh to avoid US tariffs, a process known as "trade diversion." This has increased production costs and reduced efficiency.
2.  **Increased Consumer Prices:** Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. These costs are often passed on to consumers. For instance, American consumers have faced higher prices for a wide range of goods imported from China. Similarly, Chinese consumers have seen the cost of American agricultural products, like soybeans, increase.
3.  **Volatility in Financial Markets:** The trade war has been a major source of uncertainty, causing significant volatility in global stock markets. Announcements of new tariffs or escalations in rhetoric often trigger sharp market downturns as investors fear the impact on corporate profits and global growth.

**Impact on the World Economy:**

1.  **Slower Global Economic Growth:** The trade war acts as a major drag on global economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have repeatedly cited US-China trade tensions as a primary factor in their downward revisions of global GDP growth forecasts. The uncertainty dampens business investment, and reduced trade volumes directly slow economic activity.
2.  **Weakening of the Multilateral Trading System:** The conflict represents a shift away from the rules-based multilateral trading system, embodied by the World Trade Organization (WTO), towards unilateralism and protectionism. By bypassing the WTO's dispute settlement mechanisms, both countries have undermined the institution's authority and encouraged other nations to adopt similar protectionist policies.
3.  **Mixed Impact on Third Countries:** The impact on other nations has been mixed. Some countries have benefited from trade diversion as companies relocate production away from China. However, many export-oriented economies, especially in Europe and East Asia, have suffered from the overall slowdown in global trade and demand. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the decline in commodity prices that often accompanies a global economic slowdown.

In conclusion, the US-China trade war has moved beyond a simple bilateral dispute to become a systemic threat to the global economic order. It has disrupted established trade patterns, increased costs for businesses and consumers, and created a climate of uncertainty that has slowed global growth and weakened the foundations of international economic cooperation.

**(b) Explain the threats to peace and security in the South Asia region. What are your recommendations for establishing peace in this region?**

South Asia is a region of immense strategic importance, but it is also one of the most volatile and least integrated regions in the world. It faces a complex and interconnected web of threats to its peace and security.

**Threats to Peace and Security in South Asia:**

1.  **The India-Pakistan Conflict:** This is the most enduring and dangerous threat. The rivalry, rooted in the partition of 1947 and the unresolved dispute over Kashmir, has led to multiple wars and a constant state of military tension. The fact that both nations are nuclear powers makes this conflict a grave threat to regional and global security.
2.  **Transnational Terrorism:** The region is a hotbed of transnational terrorist groups. Cross-border terrorism remains a major source of friction, particularly between India and Pakistan, and domestic terrorist organizations pose a significant threat to the internal stability of nearly every country in the region.
3.  **Internal Political Instability and Ethnic Conflict:** Many South Asian nations suffer from internal fragility, including ethnic strife, secessionist movements, weak governance, and political instability. These internal conflicts can easily spill over borders and destabilize neighboring states.
4.  **Rise of Religious Extremism:** The rise of religious fundamentalism and extremism across the region is a growing threat. It fuels intolerance, undermines secular and democratic values, and provides fertile ground for terrorist recruitment.
5.  **Geopolitical Competition:** The region has become an arena for geopolitical competition, particularly with China's increasing economic and strategic footprint through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This has intensified the strategic rivalry between India and China and drawn in other global powers, adding another layer of complexity to regional security.

**Recommendations for Establishing Peace:**

Establishing lasting peace requires sustained, multi-level efforts:

1.  **Revitalize SAARC:** The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) must be revived. The SAARC Charter should be amended to allow for the discussion of bilateral and contentious issues. A regional organization that cannot address the region's most pressing problems is ineffective.
2.  **Promote Economic Interdependence:** Deepening economic ties is a proven method for building peace. The full potential of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) must be realized by removing non-tariff barriers and investing in cross-border connectivity (roads, railways, energy grids). Economic interdependence creates a shared stake in peace.
3.  **Uninterrupted and Uninterruptible Dialogue:** A sustained and multi-level dialogue process between India and Pakistan is essential. This should include not only formal diplomatic talks but also robust **Track-II diplomacy** involving academics, retired officials, and civil society leaders to build trust and explore creative solutions.
4.  **Strengthen Counter-Terrorism Cooperation:** All states in the region must adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and establish a genuine, intelligence-sharing and joint-action mechanism to combat terrorist networks.
5.  **Encourage People-to-People Contact:** Promoting cultural exchanges, tourism, and educational collaborations can help break down stereotypes and build a foundation of mutual understanding and goodwill among the people of the region, creating a constituency for peace.

Ultimately, the key ingredient for peace in South Asia is the political will of its leaders, especially those of India and Pakistan, to move beyond historical grievances and invest in a shared future of stability and prosperity.

### **3. The policies and steps taken by Bangladesh to deal with the Rohingya crisis are being praised all over the world and have brought many benefits to the country. But there is no change in the behavior of the Myanmar government. It is not playing any effective role in taking back the Rohingya. In this situation, Bangladesh has been invited to an open discussion on the Rohingya issue at the UN Security Council. The Foreign Minister of Bangladesh will participate in this discussion. Prepare a policy brief for the Government of Bangladesh on this matter.**

**Policy Brief for the Government of Bangladesh**

**TO:** The Honourable Foreign Minister
**FROM:** Ministry of Foreign Affairs
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT: Strategy and Key Messages for the UN Security Council Open Debate on the Rohingya Crisis**

**1. Executive Summary:**
This brief outlines the strategic objectives and key messages for your address to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on the Rohingya crisis. Despite Bangladesh's humanitarian generosity and adherence to bilateral agreements, Myanmar's continued intransigence has created an unsustainable stalemate. The UNSC open debate presents a critical opportunity to shift the international focus from managing a crisis in Bangladesh to **resolving its root causes in Myanmar**. Our core objective is to galvanize the UNSC into taking concrete, binding action to compel Myanmar to create the conditions necessary for the safe, dignified, and sustainable repatriation of the Rohingya.

**2. Background and Problem Statement:**
For over six years, Bangladesh has provided shelter to more than 1.2 million Rohingya, fleeing what the UN itself has called a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing." Our response has been lauded globally. However, this protracted situation has now evolved from a purely humanitarian crisis into a grave threat to our national security and the stability of the entire region. The refugee camps face growing challenges of crime, resource scarcity, and environmental degradation. Meanwhile, Myanmar has used bilateral talks as a delaying tactic, showing no political will to implement repatriation agreements or address the core issues of Rohingya citizenship and security. The bilateral path has failed. A multilateral solution, led by the UNSC, is now the only viable path forward.

**3. Strategic Objectives at the UNSC:**

Your address should aim to achieve the following:
*   **Reframe the Narrative:** Shift the global perception from a "humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh" to a "threat to international peace and security originating from Myanmar."
*   **Generate Renewed Urgency:** Counter the "crisis fatigue" and re-energize the international community by highlighting the growing security and stability risks.
*   **Demand Concrete Action:** Move the Council beyond mere statements of concern towards the adoption of a binding resolution with clear enforcement mechanisms.

**4. Recommended Key Messages and Talking Points:**

*   **Acknowledge Global Support, but Highlight the Unsustainable Burden:** Begin by thanking the international community for its humanitarian support. Immediately pivot to the fact that this generosity cannot be a substitute for a permanent solution and that Bangladesh has shouldered this burden for far too long.
*   **Frame the Crisis as a Threat to International Peace and Security:** Emphasize that the prolonged stalemate is no longer just a bilateral issue. It is fueling transnational crime (drug and human trafficking), creating a potential breeding ground for radicalism, and destabilizing a critical geopolitical region. The crisis in Myanmar is exporting instability across the border.
*   **Expose the Failure of Bilateralism:** State clearly and firmly that Bangladesh has engaged in bilateral processes in good faith, but Myanmar has repeatedly failed to honor its commitments. Argue that the time for trusting Myanmar’s promises is over and that the responsibility now lies with the UNSC to act.
*   **Call for Specific, Binding UNSC Action Under Chapter VII:** Urge the Council to adopt a resolution that includes:
    *   **Targeted Sanctions:** Imposing sanctions on the key military officials and entities responsible for the atrocities and for obstructing repatriation.
    *   **A Global Arms Embargo:** Preventing the flow of weapons that could be used against civilian populations.
    *   **A Clear Timeline and Monitoring Mechanism:** Establishing a UN-monitored timeline for Myanmar to implement specific, verifiable conditions in Rakhine State, including granting citizenship rights to the Rohingya, ensuring their security, and providing unrestricted humanitarian access.
*   **Stress Accountability to Prevent Recurrence:** Reiterate Bangladesh's strong support for the ongoing justice and accountability processes at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Argue that there can be no sustainable solution without justice for the atrocities committed.

**5. Concluding Statement:**
Conclude by stating that Bangladesh remains committed to a peaceful solution. However, the patience of our people is wearing thin, and the security of our nation and region is at risk. The Rohingya are victims of the gravest of international crimes. They deserve justice, and the world, through its highest security body, has a solemn responsibility to provide it. The time for statements has passed. The time for decisive action is now.
