### **01. Brief Discussion on any 10 of the Following Topics (4x10 = 40)**

**(a) What is BRICS?**

BRICS is the acronym for an association of major emerging economies. The group originally comprised **B**razil, **R**ussia, **I**ndia, and **C**hina, and was formalized as a geopolitical bloc. It expanded in 2010 to include **S**outh Africa.

**Key Features:**
1.  **Economic and Geopolitical Significance:** The member countries collectively represent a significant portion of the world's population, land area, and GDP, giving them substantial influence in global affairs.
2.  **Objective:** BRICS aims to enhance cooperation among its members and challenge the political and economic dominance of the Western-led global order. It seeks a more multipolar world.
3.  **Key Institutions:** Its most notable achievement is the establishment of the **New Development Bank (NDB)** and the **Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA)**, which serve as alternatives to the World Bank and the IMF.
4.  **Recent Expansion:** In 2024, the bloc expanded significantly to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates, further increasing its global weight.

**(b) What is meant by a nation-state?**

A nation-state is a political concept where a state (a sovereign political entity with defined territory and government) is aligned with a nation (a group of people sharing a common cultural, linguistic, or ethnic identity). In its ideal form, the political boundaries of the state coincide with the cultural boundaries of the nation.

**Core principles include:**
*   **Congruence:** The state's territory is considered the homeland of the nation.
*   **National Identity:** The population shares a collective identity, history, and culture, creating a strong sense of belonging that forms the basis of political unity.
*   **Legitimacy:** The government's authority is accepted by the people because it is seen as the legitimate representative of the nation.
*   **Self-Determination:** It is the practical expression of the principle of national self-determination.

Perfect nation-states are rare, as most states are multi-ethnic. However, countries like Japan, Iceland, and Bangladesh (born from linguistic nationalism) are often cited as strong examples.

---

**(c) What are the characteristics of sovereignty?**

Sovereignty is the supreme, absolute, and legitimate authority of a state within its own territory, free from external control. It has two dimensions: internal (supreme authority over all affairs within the state) and external (independence from other states).

**Its main characteristics are:**
1.  **Permanence:** Sovereignty is a permanent feature of the state. It exists as long as the state exists, irrespective of changes in government.
2.  **Exclusiveness:** The state is the sole entity to exercise sovereign power within its territory. No other institution or state can legally exercise authority without the state's consent.
3.  **Absoluteness:** The power of the state is legally supreme. There is no higher legal authority within the state to which it must answer.
4.  **Inalienability & Indivisibility:** Sovereignty cannot be given away or transferred without the state ceasing to exist as a sovereign entity. It is also considered a complete whole and cannot be divided.

---

**(d) Write about the anti-terrorism Islamic military coalition.**

This refers to the **Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC)**, an intergovernmental alliance of Muslim-majority countries announced in December 2015 under the leadership of Saudi Arabia.

**Key aspects include:**
*   **Headquarters and Membership:** Its joint operations center is located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It consists of over 40 member states, including Bangladesh.
*   **Stated Purpose:** The official objective is to fight terrorism by coordinating and uniting efforts across four domains: **ideology, communications, counter-terrorist financing, and military**.
*   **Scope of Action:** It aims to counter extremist narratives, cut off funding for terrorist groups, share intelligence, and offer military assistance to member states for counter-terrorism operations.
*   **Geopolitical Context:** While framed as a broad counter-terrorism effort, some analysts view it as a strategic move by Saudi Arabia to assert its leadership in the Muslim world and to form a bloc that excludes its regional rival, Iran.

---

**(e) Define transit and transshipment.**

Transit and transshipment are two distinct logistics terms related to the international movement of goods.

*   **Transit:** This refers to the passage of goods from one country to a third country *through* the territory of an intermediate country. During transit, the goods do not clear customs or enter the commerce of the intermediate country; it merely acts as a land, air, or waterway corridor.
    *   **Example:** Goods from landlocked Nepal moving through Indian territory to reach the port of Kolkata for export.

*   ~~**Transshipment:** This is the process of unloading goods from one mode of transport (e.g., a large container ship) and loading them onto another at an intermediate port or terminal to complete their journey to the final destination. This is common in major hub ports.~~
    *   ~~**Example:** Cargo from China arriving at the Port of Singapore, being unloaded, and then re-loaded onto a smaller "feeder vessel" bound for Chittagong, Bangladesh.~~

**(f) What are the main driving forces of globalization?**

Globalization is the process of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence of the world's economies, cultures, and populations. The primary driving forces are:

1.  **Technological Advancements:** This is the most significant driver. The invention of the microchip, the internet, satellite communications, and mobile technology has enabled instantaneous global communication. Advances in transportation like containerization and affordable air travel have made the movement of goods and people faster and cheaper.
2.  **Economic Liberalization:** The widespread adoption of free-market policies, including the reduction of trade barriers (tariffs and quotas) and deregulation, has been crucial. This has been promoted by international institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO).
3.  **Political Changes:** The end of the Cold War dismantled the ideological barrier between East and West, opening up vast new regions to global trade, investment, and cultural exchange.
4.  **Multinational Corporations (MNCs):** Seeking to maximize profits, MNCs have created global supply chains by expanding their operations to access new markets, cheaper labor, and raw materials, thereby integrating national economies.

---

**(g) What is the difference between government and state?**

While often used interchangeably in casual language, 'state' and 'government' are distinct concepts in political science.

*   **The State:** The state is the larger, permanent political entity. It is an abstract concept comprising four essential elements: **(1) a defined territory, (2) a population, (3) a government, and (4) sovereignty.** The state continues to exist even if the government changes. For example, the "State of Bangladesh" has existed since 1971.

*   **The Government:** The government is the specific machinery or agency through which the will of the state is administered. It is the concrete, operational arm of the state responsible for making and enforcing laws. Governments are **temporary** and change through elections, coups, or revolutions. For example, the "Awami League government" is the current government of the State of Bangladesh.

**In essence:** The state is the ship, while the government is the crew that steers it. The state is permanent; the government is transient.

---

**(h) Briefly write about the "Bretton Woods" institutions.**

The Bretton Woods Institutions are the two major international financial organizations created at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA, in 1944. Their purpose was to establish a stable and prosperous global economic framework after World War II.

The two institutions are:
1.  **The International Monetary Fund (IMF):** Its original purpose was to maintain stability in the international monetary system. Today, its primary role is to provide short-to-medium-term loans to countries facing balance-of-payments crises and to act as a global lender of last resort.
2.  **The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD):** Initially created to finance the reconstruction of war-torn Europe, its mission shifted to promoting long-term economic development and poverty reduction in developing countries. The IBRD is now the main lending arm of the **World Bank Group**.

---

**(i) What is Copyright?**

Copyright is a type of intellectual property right that gives the creator of an original creative work (e.g., a book, song, painting, or computer program) a set of exclusive legal rights over its use and distribution.

**Key features include:**
*   **Protection of Expression:** Copyright protects the specific *expression* of an idea, not the underlying idea or fact itself.
*   **Exclusive Rights:** It grants the owner the sole right to reproduce the work, create derivative works based upon it, distribute copies, and perform or display the work publicly.
*   **Limited Duration:** Protection is for a limited time, typically the life of the author plus a certain number of years (in Bangladesh, it is 60 years after the author's death). Afterwards, the work enters the public domain.
*   **Purpose:** Its primary goal is to encourage creativity by allowing creators to control and benefit financially from their work.

---

**(j) Briefly write about the functions of the WTO.**

The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. Established in 1995, its main goal is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible.

**Its primary functions are:**
1.  **Administering Trade Agreements:** It oversees the implementation and monitoring of the various multilateral trade agreements that have been negotiated by its members.
2.  **Forum for Trade Negotiations:** It provides a platform for member countries to negotiate the reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade.
3.  **Handling Trade Disputes:** It operates a binding dispute settlement system where members can resolve trade grievances in a rule-based manner. This is a core function that prevents unilateral trade wars.
4.  **Monitoring National Trade Policies:** It regularly reviews the trade policies of its members to ensure transparency and compliance with WTO rules.
5.  **Technical Assistance:** It provides technical assistance and training to developing countries to help them build their trading capacity and benefit from international trade.

---

**(k) What steps has ASEAN taken to achieve economic prosperity?**

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has taken several key steps to foster regional economic prosperity:

1.  **ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA):** Established in 1992, AFTA was the foundational step to reduce tariffs on most goods traded within the region, aiming to increase the bloc's competitive edge as a single production base.
2.  **ASEAN Economic Community (AEC):** Launched in 2015, the AEC is a more ambitious project to create a single market and production base. It focuses on the free flow of goods, services, investment, capital, and skilled labor.
3.  **External Free Trade Agreements (FTAs):** ASEAN acts as a single bloc to negotiate FTAs with major global partners like China, Japan, South Korea, and India. The **Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)** is the most significant of these, creating the world's largest trading bloc.
4.  **Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC):** This initiative focuses on improving physical infrastructure (transport, energy), institutional connectivity (trade facilitation), and people-to-people links to reduce the cost of doing business and better integrate the regional economy.

---

**(l) Briefly discuss what is meant by Balance of Power.**

Balance of Power is a core theory in international relations, particularly within the realist school of thought. It describes a state of stability in the international system where states act to prevent any single state or coalition from becoming powerful enough to dominate all others (i.e., becoming a hegemon).

**Key aspects include:**
*   **Core Goal:** The primary objective is not to create permanent peace, but to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states within the system.
*   **Mechanisms:** States maintain this balance primarily through two strategies:
    *   **External Balancing:** Forming alliances with other states to counter a common threat (e.g., the formation of NATO to balance the Soviet Union).
    *   **Internal Balancing:** Increasing one's own military and economic capabilities to match those of a rival state.
*   **Fluidity:** The balance is not static; it is a dynamic process where alliances shift and power adjusts in response to perceived threats. Today, the concept is used to analyze the complex power dynamics between the US, China, and Russia.

### **02. Answer any three of the following questions (15x3=45)**

**(a) Identify the important issues in Bangladesh-India bilateral relations.**

The relationship between Bangladesh and India is one of the most significant in South Asia, rooted in shared history, culture, and the pivotal support of India during Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War. While often described as a "special relationship," it is complex and marked by several critical issues that require continuous dialogue and resolution.

The most important issues are:

1.  **Water Sharing of Common Rivers:** This is arguably the most sensitive and vital issue. While the 1996 **Ganges Water Treaty** stands as a landmark of successful cooperation, the failure to conclude a treaty on the **Teesta River** remains a major point of contention. The reduced flow of the Teesta during the dry season severely impacts agriculture, irrigation, and livelihoods in northern Bangladesh, making it a persistent source of political friction. The management of 52 other common rivers also requires a comprehensive framework.

2.  **Border Management and Security:** The 4,096-kilometer border presents multifaceted challenges. A major irritant is the **killing of Bangladeshi nationals** by the Indian Border Security Force (BSF), which creates significant public outrage in Bangladesh. While both sides cooperate to manage trans-border crime like smuggling, human trafficking, and drug trade, a "zero-death" border remains an unfulfilled goal. On a positive note, the peaceful resolution of the decades-old land and maritime boundary disputes through the **Land Boundary Agreement (2015)** was a historic achievement.

3.  **Trade and Economic Imbalance:** India is Bangladesh's second-largest trade partner, but the trade balance is heavily skewed in India's favor. Bangladesh has long sought more equitable market access. Key obstacles include **non-tariff barriers (NTBs)** such as complex customs procedures, testing and certification requirements, and the imposition of anti-dumping duties on key Bangladeshi products like jute goods, which hinder export potential.

4.  **Connectivity and Transit:** Enhancing connectivity (road, rail, waterways) is a major area of cooperation, seen as a "win-win" for both nations. The agreement allowing India to use Bangladesh's **Chattogram and Mongla ports** for transit to its northeastern states is a game-changer. However, ensuring that Bangladesh gains commensurate economic benefits from these arrangements through transit fees and the development of its logistics sector is a key point of discussion.

5.  **The Rohingya Crisis:** Bangladesh hosts over a million Rohingya refugees and seeks a more robust and proactive role from India, as a regional power with influence over Myanmar. Bangladesh expects India to apply greater political and diplomatic pressure on the Myanmar government to create conditions conducive for the safe, dignified, and sustainable repatriation of the refugees.

6.  **Security Cooperation:** This is a cornerstone of the current positive relationship. Bangladesh's "zero-tolerance" policy towards anti-India insurgent groups using its territory has been highly appreciated by India and has built significant trust. Cooperation in counter-terrorism, intelligence sharing, and disaster management remains strong.

In conclusion, while the relationship has deepened significantly, its future trajectory depends on the political will of both nations to address the unresolved issues, particularly water sharing and border management, in a spirit of mutual trust and respect.

**(c) Determine the nature of China-US relations.**

The relationship between the People's Republic of China and the United States is the most complex and consequential bilateral relationship of the 21st century. Its nature defies any single label, as it is a dynamic and often contradictory mix of **strategic competition, deep economic interdependence, and selective cooperation.**

1.  **Strategic Competition and Rivalry:** This has become the dominant feature of the relationship.
    *   **Geopolitical Competition:** The US perceives China's growing military power and assertiveness as a challenge to its global leadership. This is most evident in the Indo-Pacific region, where the US promotes its "Free and Open Indo-Pacific" strategy through alliances like the **Quad** and **AUKUS** to counter China's influence. The issue of **Taiwan** remains the most dangerous potential flashpoint.
    *   **Technological Competition:** A "tech war" is underway, with the US imposing restrictions on Chinese tech giants like **Huawei** over national security concerns. The rivalry to dominate future technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and semiconductors is a central battleground.
    *   **Ideological Rivalry:** The relationship is framed as a contest between the US-led liberal democratic model and China's model of authoritarian state-led capitalism. Issues of human rights in Xinjiang and the erosion of autonomy in Hong Kong are major sources of friction.

2.  **Deep Economic Interdependence:** Despite the rivalry, the two economies are profoundly intertwined, a condition sometimes called "Chimerica."
    *   **Trade and Investment:** China is one of America's largest trading partners, and US corporations have massive investments in China, both as a manufacturing base and a consumer market.
    *   **Financial Linkages:** China is a major holder of US government debt. This deep financial and supply-chain integration means that a full "decoupling" would be economically catastrophic for both countries and the global economy. This interdependence acts as a significant brake on open conflict, distinguishing it from the US-Soviet Cold War.

3.  **Selective Cooperation:** On issues where their interests align, cooperation is necessary and does occur, albeit with difficulty.
    *   **Climate Change:** As the world's two largest carbon emitters, no global solution to climate change is possible without their joint effort.
    *   **Global Health:** The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for cooperation in preventing and responding to global health crises.
    *   **Nuclear Non-proliferation:** Both nations have a shared interest in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, leading to occasional collaboration on issues related to Iran and North Korea.

In conclusion, the nature of US-China relations is one of "coopetition" – a simultaneous and unstable mix of cooperation and competition. It is a defining rivalry that will shape global politics for decades, with the primary challenge being to manage the intense competition to avoid escalating into direct conflict.

**(d) (i) What are the arguments for increasing the number of permanent members of the UN Security Council? (ii) Discuss Bangladesh's participation in UN peacekeeping missions.**

**(i) Arguments for Increasing the Number of Permanent Members (6 marks)**

The demand for increasing the number of permanent members of the UN Security Council is driven by the argument that its current composition is outdated and unrepresentative of the 21st-century world. The key arguments are:

1.  **Reflects an Anachronistic World Order:** The Council's permanent five (P5) members represent the victors of World War II in 1945. This structure fails to reflect the dramatic shifts in global economic and political power over the last 75 years. Major powers like **Germany, Japan, India, and Brazil (the G4 nations)** have emerged as significant global actors but are denied a permanent voice.
2.  **Lack of Equitable Geographical Representation:** The current composition is geographically imbalanced. Entire continents like **Africa and Latin America** have no permanent representation, even though a significant portion of the Council's agenda focuses on conflicts in these regions. This undermines the Council's legitimacy and is seen as a vestige of a colonial-era power structure.
3.  **Enhanced Legitimacy and Effectiveness:** A more representative and inclusive Council would command greater moral and political authority. Its decisions would be seen as more legitimate by the wider UN membership, likely leading to broader support and more effective implementation of its resolutions.
4.  **Counterbalancing the Veto:** While expansion does not abolish the veto, adding new permanent members could act as a counterweight to the existing P5. It could make it more difficult for a single P5 member to use the veto for narrow national interests, fostering greater consensus-building.

**(ii) Bangladesh's Participation in UN Peacekeeping Missions (9 marks)**

Bangladesh's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations is a cornerstone of its foreign policy and a source of immense national pride and international prestige. Since its first deployment in 1988, Bangladesh has consistently been one of the top troop- and police-contributing countries in the world.

**Key Aspects of Participation:**

*   **Scale and Scope:** Bangladesh has contributed over 175,000 personnel to nearly 60 UN missions in over 40 countries, from Africa and the Middle East to Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Bangladeshi peacekeepers have served in some of the most challenging conflict zones, including Sierra Leone, Congo, Ivory Coast, and South Sudan.
*   **Commitment to Global Peace:** This participation is rooted in Bangladesh's constitutional commitment (Article 25) to promote international peace and security. It demonstrates the country's transformation from a recipient of international aid to a responsible global actor actively contributing to stability.
*   **Professionalism and Reputation:** Bangladeshi peacekeepers are renowned for their high level of professionalism, discipline, and dedication. They are particularly praised for their people-centric approach, engaging in humanitarian activities like building schools and providing medical aid, which helps in winning the trust and confidence of local populations. The increasing participation of **female peacekeepers** from Bangladesh has also been widely acclaimed.
*   **Benefits for Bangladesh:**
    *   **Enhanced Soft Power:** Peacekeeping has significantly boosted Bangladesh's international image and diplomatic influence.
    *   **Professional Development:** It provides invaluable operational experience, training, and exposure for the Bangladeshi Armed Forces and Police, enhancing their capabilities.
    *   **Economic Gains:** Reimbursements from the UN for troop and equipment contributions are a significant source of foreign currency.

In summary, Bangladesh's role in UN peacekeeping is a remarkable success story. It is a powerful expression of the country's commitment to global peace and has earned it immense respect and goodwill on the world stage, solidifying its identity as a force for peace.

### **03. Discuss the necessary measures for the solution and prevention of recurrence of the problem arising from the theft of Bangladesh Bank's reserves from the Federal Reserve Bank.**

The 2016 cyber heist of $81 million from Bangladesh Bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was a catastrophic security breach that exposed critical vulnerabilities in the global financial system. Addressing this issue requires a two-pronged approach: **(1) measures for the solution (recovering the stolen funds)** and **(2) measures for the prevention of recurrence.**

**1. Measures for Solution (Recovery of Stolen Funds)**

The recovery process is a complex, long-term endeavor requiring a multi-faceted strategy:

*   **Sustained Legal Action:** The primary recourse is legal action in the jurisdictions where the money was laundered. Bangladesh Bank has correctly filed a civil lawsuit in New York against the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) of the Philippines and other entities involved. This legal pressure must be relentlessly pursued to hold the responsible parties accountable and recover the assets.
*   **Intensive Diplomatic Engagement:** The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must lead a continuous diplomatic campaign. High-level engagement with the governments of the Philippines and other relevant countries is crucial to ensure their political cooperation, expedite their legal processes, and prevent procedural delays from bogging down the case.
*   **International Law Enforcement Cooperation:** Strengthening collaboration with international agencies like the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Interpol is vital. Sharing intelligence and evidence helps in tracing the complex money trail through the international casino system and building an irrefutable legal case against the perpetrators.
*   **Asset Recovery Negotiations:** While pursuing litigation, Bangladesh should remain open to negotiating out-of-court settlements with complicit institutions like RCBC. This pragmatic approach could lead to a faster recovery of at least a portion of the stolen funds.

**2. Measures for Prevention of Recurrence**

This is the most critical part, as it involves fortifying Bangladesh's own financial infrastructure to prevent future attacks. The measures must be comprehensive, covering technology, procedures, and people.

*   **Strengthening Cybersecurity Infrastructure:**
    *   **Technical Overhaul:** Implementing a multi-layered "defense-in-depth" security architecture. This includes next-generation firewalls, advanced intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), and robust endpoint security for all devices connected to the network.
    *   **Isolating Critical Systems:** The SWIFT system, used for international financial messaging, must be completely air-gapped or isolated from the bank's general internal network to prevent lateral movement by attackers.
*   **Reforming Internal Controls and Procedures:**
    *   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** No high-value transaction should be possible without verification from multiple, independent officials using different authentication methods. The "four-eyes principle" (requiring two individuals to approve an action) must be strictly enforced.
    *   **24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC):** Establishing a dedicated, round-the-clock SOC staffed by skilled analysts to monitor all network traffic and financial transactions in real-time. The SOC must have the authority to halt suspicious transactions immediately.
    *   **Eliminating Manual Overrides:** Removing any possibility of bypassing automated security checks, which was a key failure in the 2016 heist.
*   **Human Resource Development and Awareness:**
    *   **Continuous Training:** The human element is often the weakest link. Mandatory, regular cybersecurity training for all employees on recognizing phishing, social engineering, and malware threats is essential.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implementing the principle of "least privilege," where employees are given access only to the data and systems absolutely necessary for their jobs.
*   **Enhanced International Collaboration:**
    *   **Real-time Verification Protocols:** Establishing clear, real-time communication protocols with correspondent banks like the Federal Reserve to verify unusually large or atypically patterned transaction requests before they are executed.

In conclusion, the Bangladesh Bank heist served as a severe wake-up call. While the fight to recover the stolen money requires persistent legal and diplomatic efforts, the ultimate solution lies in preventing a recurrence. This demands a holistic and relentless commitment to building a fortress-like security culture that combines cutting-edge technology, iron-clad procedures, and a vigilant, well-trained workforce.
