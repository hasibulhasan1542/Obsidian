### **01. Brief Answers (4x10=40)**

**(a) What is the purpose of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)? Discuss briefly.**

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance. Its primary purpose is to maintain peace, security, and stability across the vast Eurasian region.

The core objectives of the SCO are:
*   **Combating the "Three Evils":** Its foremost security goal is to jointly combat terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism within the member states.
*   **Economic Cooperation:** To promote regional economic cooperation in areas like trade, transport, energy, and technology.
*   **Geopolitical Balancing:** To serve as a regional counterweight to the influence of the United States and Western-led alliances like NATO, promoting a multipolar world order.
*   **Regional Stability:** To resolve border disputes among member states and coordinate responses to regional security challenges, such as the situation in Afghanistan.

**(b) What is the main purpose of NATO? Do you think NATO is playing an effective role in fulfilling its purpose?**

The main purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means. Its core principle is **collective defense**, enshrined in **Article 5** of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Its original purpose during the Cold War was to deter Soviet aggression in Europe.

Evaluating its effectiveness:
*   **Argument for Effectiveness:** NATO was highly effective in its original mission of deterring the Soviet Union, ultimately contributing to the peaceful end of the Cold War. In the current context, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has revitalized the alliance, demonstrating its continued relevance as a security guarantor. The accession of historically neutral countries like Finland and Sweden is a testament to its perceived effectiveness and appeal.
*   **Argument for Ineffectiveness/Challenges:** Post-Cold War, NATO struggled with its purpose, and its "out-of-area" mission in Afghanistan had mixed results. The alliance has also faced internal divisions over burden-sharing and strategic priorities.

Overall, while it faces challenges, NATO has proven remarkably effective in its core purpose of collective defense, and its role has become more critical in the face of renewed aggression in Europe.

**(c) What is meant by QUAD? What are the goals and objectives of QUAD's formation?**

QUAD is the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a strategic security dialogue between four countries: **the United States, Australia, India, and Japan.** It is an informal grouping, not a formal military alliance like NATO.

The primary goal of the QUAD is to ensure a **"Free and Open Indo-Pacific."** This overarching goal encompasses several key objectives:
*   **Counterbalancing China:** The unstated but most significant objective is to create a strategic coalition of democracies to counter China's growing military and economic assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.
*   **Upholding a Rules-Based Order:** To promote and protect the international rules-based order, including freedom of navigation and overflight, particularly in the South China Sea.
*   **Cooperation on Non-Traditional Security:** To cooperate on a range of contemporary challenges, including maritime security, cybersecurity, climate change, infrastructure development, and ensuring resilient supply chains.
*   **Providing Alternatives:** To offer regional countries alternatives to Chinese financing and technology for infrastructure and development.

**(d) What is the underlying logic for having the veto power provision in the UN Security Council's voting system?**

The underlying logic for the veto power was a **pragmatic and realist compromise** made during the UN's formation in 1945. The primary goal was to ensure that the world's most powerful nations (the victors of WWII) would join the organization and remain in it.

The logic rests on two key arguments:
1.  **To Prevent Great Power Conflict:** The veto ensures that the Security Council cannot take enforcement action against one of its five permanent members (P5) or their core allies. Such an action would likely lead to a major war between great powers, destroying the UN itself, much like the League of Nations failed. The veto acts as a safety valve to prevent this.
2.  **To Ensure Effectiveness:** It was believed that no Security Council resolution could be effectively enforced without the consent and cooperation of the world's great powers. The veto ensures that any major action has the backing of, or at least is not opposed by, all P5 members, making its implementation more likely.

In essence, the veto was the price that had to be paid to secure great power participation in the UN's collective security system.

**(e) What does multilateralism mean? Has its importance increased in the context of the current world situation?**

Multilateralism is a foreign policy approach where multiple countries work together in concert on a given issue. It involves cooperation through international institutions and adherence to shared norms and rules to address common challenges. It is the opposite of unilateralism (acting alone) or bilateralism (acting with one other country).

Yes, the importance of multilateralism has significantly increased in the current world situation. This is because the world's most pressing challenges are inherently global and transnational, and no single nation can solve them alone. These challenges include:
*   **Climate Change:** Requires a coordinated global effort to reduce emissions.
*   **Pandemics:** As seen with COVID-19, global health security requires international cooperation on surveillance, research, and vaccine distribution.
*   **Global Economic Stability:** Managing financial crises and ensuring supply chain resilience requires multilateral coordination.
*   **Cybersecurity and Terrorism:** These are borderless threats that necessitate intelligence sharing and joint action.

In an increasingly interconnected world, multilateral cooperation is not just an option but a necessity for survival and prosperity.

**(f) What is meant by Soft Power? How realistic is its application in implementing state policy?**

Coined by Joseph Nye, Soft Power is the ability of a state to influence other states and achieve its goals through attraction and persuasion rather than through coercion (Hard Power). It arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political values (like democracy), and foreign policies.

The application of soft power is realistic but has limitations.
*   **Realism of Application:** It is a highly effective long-term tool. For example, a country's positive image, built through cultural exports and educational exchanges, can create a favorable environment for its businesses and diplomatic initiatives. It can build trust and legitimacy, making other countries more willing to cooperate.
*   **Limitations:** Soft power is not a magic bullet. It is slow to build and easily lost. It is often ineffective against hard military threats in the short term; soft power cannot stop a tank. Its impact is indirect and difficult to measure.

Therefore, its application is most realistic when used as a component of a "smart power" strategy, which intelligently combines the tools of both hard and soft power.

**(g) What is a hybrid war? What is the objective of a hybrid war?**

A hybrid war is a military strategy that blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare, and cyber warfare with other influencing methods, such as fake news, diplomacy, and economic pressure. It is a modern form of conflict that operates across multiple domains simultaneously.

The primary objective of a hybrid war is to **destabilize and weaken a target state from within without resorting to a full-scale, declared military invasion.** The goals include:
*   **Creating Confusion and Division:** To sow discord, erode public trust in government and institutions, and polarize society using disinformation and propaganda.
*   **Paralyzing Decision-Making:** To create ambiguity and make it difficult for the target nation's leadership to formulate a clear response.
*   **Achieving Strategic Goals below the Threshold of War:** To achieve political objectives (e.g., annexing territory, changing a government's policy) while maintaining plausible deniability and avoiding a conventional military response from the international community.

**(h) What are sanctions? How much have the sanctions imposed by the West on Russia in the Ukraine-Russia war affected its economy?**

Sanctions are punitive measures taken by one or more countries against another country to try to persuade it to change its behavior. They are a tool of foreign policy that falls between diplomacy and military force. Sanctions can include arms embargoes, trade restrictions, travel bans, and, most significantly, financial sanctions like freezing assets and cutting off access to the international banking system.

The sanctions imposed by the West on Russia have had a **significant but not catastrophic** effect on its economy.
*   **Major Impacts:** They have frozen hundreds of billions of dollars of Russia's central bank reserves, cut off major Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system, and caused an exodus of hundreds of Western companies. This led to an initial economic shock, a collapse in the ruble, and forced Russia into a technical recession.
*   **Resilience and Adaptation:** However, the Russian economy has proven more resilient than expected. This is due to soaring global energy prices (which boosted Russia's export revenues), its ability to redirect oil sales to countries like China and India, strict capital controls, and its years of preparation for such a scenario (building up its "fortress Russia" economy).

In conclusion, the sanctions have severely damaged certain sectors of the Russian economy and isolated it from the West, but they have not yet achieved their ultimate goal of crippling Russia's ability to wage war.

**(i) What is meant by 'backdoor diplomacy'? Discuss briefly.**

Backdoor diplomacy (also known as backchannel diplomacy) is the use of secret, unofficial, or informal communication channels between parties in a conflict, usually governments, that are unable or unwilling to engage in formal, public negotiations. It runs parallel to, or sometimes in the absence of, official diplomatic relations.

The purpose of a backchannel is to:
*   **Explore Possibilities:** Allow parties to test ideas, gauge intentions, and explore the potential for a peace settlement without the risk of public failure or political backlash.
*   **Build Trust:** Create a space for adversaries to build personal relationships and trust away from the public eye.
*   **Convey Sensitive Information:** Transmit sensitive messages or proposals that cannot be communicated through official channels.

A classic example is the secret talks held in Oslo, Norway, between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords.

---

**(j) What is meant by 'food nationalism'? Why does it arise?**

Food nationalism is a protectionist policy where a country restricts its exports of food staples to ensure it has enough supply for its own domestic population and to control rising food prices at home. It is an inward-looking policy that prioritizes national food security over international trade commitments.

Food nationalism arises primarily in times of **global crisis, fear, and uncertainty**. The main triggers are:
*   **Global Supply Shocks:** A major event that disrupts global food supply chains, such as a war involving major agricultural exporters (e.g., the Russia-Ukraine war impacting wheat supplies) or a global pandemic.
*   **Climate-Related Crop Failures:** Widespread droughts, floods, or other extreme weather events that cause poor harvests in multiple food-producing regions.
*   **Panic and Speculation:** Fear that other countries will restrict their exports can create a domino effect, where countries rush to hoard their own supplies, even if there is no immediate shortage.

### **02. Answer any three of the following questions (15x3=45)**

**(a) What are the reasons for the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine? Do you think Russia is deliberately prolonging the war? Give your opinion.**

The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, is the culmination of long-standing historical grievances and more immediate geopolitical conflicts.

**Reasons for the War:**

1.  **NATO Expansion:** From Russia's perspective, the primary reason is the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since the end of the Cold War. Russia views the potential inclusion of Ukraine, a large country on its immediate border, as a direct and unacceptable threat to its national security and sphere of influence.
2.  **Historical and Ideological Factors:** President Vladimir Putin has frequently articulated a view that denies Ukraine's legitimacy as a fully independent state, asserting that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people." This historical revisionism seeks to re-establish Russian dominance over what it considers its historical lands. The invasion can be seen as an attempt to reverse the consequences of the Soviet Union's collapse.
3.  **The 2014 Annexation and Donbas Conflict:** The current war is an escalation of a conflict that began in 2014. Following a pro-Western revolution in Ukraine, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and backed separatist forces in the eastern Donbas region, initiating a low-intensity war that claimed thousands of lives over eight years.
4.  **Ukraine's Pro-Western Shift:** Ukraine's steady drift towards the West, seeking deeper integration with the European Union and NATO, was seen by Moscow as a betrayal and a threat. Russia's goal was to halt and reverse this pro-Western orientation, by force if necessary.

**Is Russia Deliberately Prolonging the War?**

In my opinion, Russia is not prolonging the war out of a deliberate strategic choice to do so, but rather because it has **failed to achieve its initial objectives and is now locked in a costly war of attrition** that it cannot easily win or gracefully exit.

*   **Initial Failure:** Russia's initial plan was likely for a swift "special military operation" to decapitate the Ukrainian government in Kyiv and install a pro-Russian regime. This failed due to fierce Ukrainian resistance and massive Western military support.
*   **Shift to a War of Attrition:** Having failed in its initial blitzkrieg, Russia shifted its strategy to a grinding war of attrition, focused on conquering and annexing territory in eastern and southern Ukraine. This prolonged conflict is not a sign of a deliberate strategy but a consequence of its initial military and political miscalculations.
*   **Inability to Accept Defeat:** The Putin regime has invested immense political capital and national resources in the war. A clear defeat is politically untenable and could threaten the stability of the regime itself. Therefore, Russia is forced to prolong the conflict, hoping to outlast Ukraine's and the West's will to fight, rather than accept a humiliating withdrawal.

In conclusion, the war is being prolonged not by deliberate design, but by a combination of Russia's initial military failure, its inability to accept defeat, and the determined resistance of Ukraine backed by the West.

**(b) According to which agreement between India and Bangladesh was the 'Joint Rivers Commission' established? Analyze the role of this commission in ensuring the fair share of water from the common rivers for Bangladesh.**

The **Joint Rivers Commission (JRC)** between Bangladesh and India was established in **1972**. Its formation was formalized through a joint declaration by the Prime Ministers of both countries, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Indira Gandhi, making it one of the earliest institutional mechanisms established to foster bilateral cooperation following Bangladesh's independence.

**Analysis of the JRC's Role:**

The JRC was created with the noble objective of working together to maximize the benefits from their 54 common rivers and to formulate joint projects for mutual benefit. However, its role in ensuring Bangladesh's fair share of water has been a story of limited success and significant frustration.

**Successes and Positive Aspects:**

1.  **A Vital Institutional Forum:** The JRC's most significant success is its very existence. It provides a permanent, institutionalized platform for dialogue and technical-level discussions between the two countries. It keeps the critical issue of water sharing on the bilateral agenda.
2.  **Facilitating the Ganges Water Treaty:** The JRC played a crucial role in the technical groundwork, data exchange, and negotiations that ultimately led to the signing of the landmark **Ganges Water Treaty in 1996**. This 30-year treaty is the single most significant achievement in the history of bilateral water cooperation and remains a testament to what the JRC can help achieve when there is political will.
3.  **Data Sharing and Flood Forecasting:** The JRC has been reasonably effective in facilitating the exchange of hydrological data, particularly for flood forecasting and warning, which has helped mitigate the damage from seasonal floods in Bangladesh.

**Failures and Limitations:**

1.  **Inability to Resolve the Teesta Dispute:** The JRC's most glaring failure is its inability to produce an agreement on the sharing of the Teesta River's waters. Despite decades of meetings and technical studies, a treaty remains elusive, primarily due to political obstacles within India (specifically, the opposition of the West Bengal state government). This failure directly impacts the livelihoods of millions in northern Bangladesh.
2.  **Lack of Mandate for Water Management:** The JRC is largely an advisory body. It can conduct studies and make recommendations, but it has no power to make binding decisions or to implement them. Its role is limited to technical discussions, and the final decisions are always political.
3.  **Focus on Sharing Scarcity, Not Augmenting Flow:** The commission's work has overwhelmingly focused on how to divide the existing (and often dwindling) water flows rather than on cooperative projects to augment the rivers' dry-season flows through measures like building reservoirs or inter-basin water transfers.

**Conclusion:**
The role of the Joint Rivers Commission has been mixed. It has been a valuable technical forum and was instrumental in the success of the Ganges Treaty. However, its overall effectiveness in ensuring Bangladesh's fair share of water from all common rivers has been severely hampered by its advisory nature and its inability to overcome political deadlocks, most notably on the Teesta issue. For the JRC to become more effective, it needs to be empowered with a stronger mandate and, most importantly, be backed by the unwavering political will of the highest leadership in both countries to find equitable and just solutions.

### **3. There is a potential labor market for Bangladeshi human resources in Eastern Europe. Write a letter of advice addressed to the government to utilize this potential extensively.**

**To:**
The Honourable Minister
Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment
Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh

**Subject: Advisory on a Strategic Action Plan to Capitalize on the Emerging Labour Market in Eastern Europe**

**Honourable Minister,**

This advisory serves to draw your attention to the significant and growing potential of Eastern European countries as a new and valuable destination for Bangladeshi human resources. Nations such as Romania, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are experiencing labour shortages due to demographic shifts and economic growth. This presents a golden opportunity for Bangladesh to diversify its overseas employment markets beyond its traditional strongholds in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

To effectively and extensively capitalize on this potential, a proactive, government-led, multi-pronged strategy is urgently required. I respectfully offer the following recommendations for your consideration:

**1. Proactive Diplomatic and Legal Frameworks:**
*   **Government-to-Government (G2G) Agreements:** Our primary focus must be on establishing formal labour agreements and Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with target countries. These agreements should ensure safe, orderly, and regular migration, guaranteeing fair wages, decent working conditions, and the protection of our workers' rights.
*   **Diplomatic Missions' Role:** Our embassies in the region must be empowered and tasked with actively exploring labour market demands, building relationships with employers, and facilitating the recruitment process. They should act as the primary facilitators and protectors of our workers.

**2. Skill Development Aligned with Market Demand:**
*   **Market-Specific Skill Mapping:** We must conduct thorough research to identify the specific skills in demand in Eastern Europe (e.g., skilled construction workers, welders, manufacturing operators, IT professionals, healthcare assistants).
*   **Targeted Training Programs:** The Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET) should design and implement specialized training and certification programs tailored to meet these specific demands. This should include basic language training (e.g., Polish, Romanian) and cultural orientation to help our workers adapt more easily.

**3. Streamlining and Regulating the Recruitment Process:**
*   **Ethical Recruitment:** The government must take a strong stance against unethical recruitment practices. A transparent and low-cost migration process should be established, preferably through a government-run entity like the Bangladesh Overseas Employment and Services Limited (BOESL), to protect workers from exploitation by private recruiting agencies.
*   **Creation of a Verified Database:** Develop a national database of skilled and certified workers ready for deployment. This would allow the government to respond quickly and efficiently to demands from foreign employers.

**4. Ensuring Worker Welfare and Support:**
*   **Pre-Departure Orientation:** Comprehensive pre-departure briefings are essential to inform workers about their rights, responsibilities, and the legal and cultural context of their destination country.
*   **On-Site Support:** Our embassies must have dedicated welfare wings with adequate resources to provide consular support, legal aid, and assistance to our workers in case of disputes or emergencies.

Honourable Minister, the emergence of the Eastern European labour market is a strategic opportunity that we cannot afford to miss. It offers a chance to increase our remittance inflows, reduce pressure on traditional labour markets, and enhance the global footprint of our skilled workforce. A concerted and strategic effort, led by your esteemed ministry, can transform this potential into a tangible reality, bringing immense benefits to our people and our national economy.

Sincerely,

A concerned and hopeful citizen.
