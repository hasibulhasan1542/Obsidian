Of course. Here are the elaborated answers to the questions from the "International Affairs" paper, as requested.

***

### **Question 1: Answer the following questions (4x10=40)**

#### **(a) What is the purpose of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation? Discuss briefly.**

**Answer:**

The **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)** is a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance. It was founded in 2001 by the leaders of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. India and Pakistan joined as full members in 2017.

The **primary purpose** of the SCO is to ensure stability, security, and cooperation across the vast Eurasian landmass. Its objectives can be broken down as follows:

1.  **Combating the "Three Evils":** The SCO's foundational security objective is to collectively combat terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism. This is its most prominent and active area of cooperation, manifested through its Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) based in Tashkent, which facilitates intelligence sharing and joint counter-terrorism exercises.

2.  **Maintaining Regional Security and Stability:** Beyond counter-terrorism, the SCO aims to address broader security challenges, including drug trafficking, organized crime, and cybersecurity threats. It provides a platform for member states, particularly those in Central Asia, to coordinate on border security and prevent instability from spilling across frontiers.

3.  **Promoting Economic Cooperation:** A growing objective is to foster economic and trade integration among member states. This includes promoting connectivity projects (like China's Belt and Road Initiative), facilitating trade and investment, and cooperating in sectors like energy, transport, and technology. The goal is to create a more integrated Eurasian economic space.

4.  **Balancing Western Influence:** Politically, the SCO serves as a platform for its members, especially China and Russia, to promote a multipolar world order and counterbalance the political and security influence of the United States and its allies (like NATO) in the region. It champions the principles of non-interference and respect for state sovereignty.

In essence, the SCO functions as a comprehensive regional organization aimed at creating a secure and cooperative environment in Eurasia, driven by the shared interests of its member states in maintaining internal stability and enhancing their collective international standing.

#### **(b) What is the main purpose of NATO? Do you think NATO is playing an effective role in fulfilling its purpose?**

**Answer:**

The **North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)** is a military and political alliance established in 1949. Its **main purpose**, as enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, is **collective defense**. This principle states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all members. NATO was originally created to deter Soviet expansionism in Europe during the Cold War.

**Effectiveness of NATO in Fulfilling Its Purpose:**

Whether NATO is playing an effective role is a subject of ongoing debate, with strong arguments on both sides.

**Arguments for its Effectiveness:**
1.  **Successful Deterrence during the Cold War:** For over four decades, NATO successfully deterred a direct military attack from the Soviet Union on Western Europe, arguably its greatest achievement. The alliance's military strength and commitment to collective defense maintained a fragile peace.
2.  **Post-Cold War Adaptation:** After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO adapted its mission. It successfully intervened to stop ethnic cleansing in the Balkans (Bosnia and Kosovo) in the 1990s, demonstrating its capacity for crisis management.
3.  **Renewed Purpose in Response to Russia:** Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 have given NATO a renewed sense of purpose. The alliance has demonstrated unity and resolve, strengthening its eastern flank, increasing defense spending, and expanding its membership (Finland and Sweden), thereby effectively deterring further Russian aggression against its members.

**Arguments Against its Effectiveness (or Criticisms):**
1.  **Intervention in Libya and Afghanistan:** NATO's intervention in Libya in 2011 is criticized for exceeding its mandate and contributing to state collapse and prolonged instability. Similarly, its long and costly mission in Afghanistan failed to create a stable, democratic state, ending in a chaotic withdrawal and the return of the Taliban.
2.  **Provoking Russia:** Critics argue that NATO's eastward expansion after the Cold War, despite assurances to the contrary, was a provocative act that disregarded Russia's security concerns and contributed to the current conflict in Ukraine. From this perspective, it failed to build a cooperative European security architecture.
3.  **Internal Divisions:** The alliance often faces internal divisions, with members like Turkey pursuing divergent foreign policy goals. Disagreements over burden-sharing (defense spending) and strategic priorities have at times weakened its cohesion and effectiveness.

**Conclusion:**
In my opinion, NATO has been highly effective in its core mission of **collective defense for its members**. No member state has ever been attacked. However, its effectiveness in post-Cold War crisis management and in its role as a stabilizing force beyond its borders is far more mixed, with notable successes and significant failures.

#### **(c) What is meant by QUAD? What are the goals and objectives of the formation of QUAD?**

**Answer:**

**QUAD** is the informal, strategic security dialogue known as the **Quadrilateral Security Dialogue**. It comprises four democratic nations: the **United States, Japan, Australia, and India**. It is not a formal military alliance like NATO but a diplomatic and security partnership.

The **goals and objectives** of the QUAD have evolved but are centered around ensuring a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.

1.  **Promoting a "Free and Open Indo-Pacific":** This is the central, overarching objective. It signifies a commitment to upholding a rules-based international order in the region, characterized by freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, and respect for international law (particularly the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea - UNCLOS).

2.  **Counterbalancing China's Influence:** Although not always explicitly stated, a primary unspoken goal is to create a strategic counterweight to China's growing military and economic assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific. The QUAD aims to deter coercive actions and ensure that no single power can dominate the region.

3.  **Cooperation on Non-Traditional Security Threats:** The QUAD has expanded its agenda beyond traditional security to address contemporary challenges. This includes:
    *   **Health Security:** Collaborating on vaccine distribution (the Quad Vaccine Partnership) and preparing for future pandemics.
    *   **Climate Change:** Working together on climate adaptation, resilience, and clean energy transition.
    *   **Critical and Emerging Technologies:** Cooperating on setting standards and securing supply chains for technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors.

4.  **Providing Regional Public Goods:** The QUAD aims to be a force for good in the region by providing practical support and public goods, such as infrastructure development, maritime domain awareness (to combat illegal fishing and piracy), and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR). This practical cooperation is intended to offer regional countries a positive alternative to reliance on China.

#### **(d) What is the underlying logic for the provision of veto power in the UN Security Council?**

**Answer:**

The veto power is the right of the five permanent members (P5) of the UN Security Council—**China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States**—to reject any "substantive" resolution. The underlying logic for this provision, though highly controversial today, was rooted in the political realism of its post-World War II founders.

1.  **Ensuring Great Power Participation:** The primary logic was to prevent the UN from suffering the same fate as its predecessor, the League of Nations. The League failed largely because major powers, including the US, were not members or did not feel their core interests were protected. The veto was a concession to the world's most powerful nations, ensuring their participation and commitment to the new global organization.

2.  **Preventing Conflict Among Great Powers:** The founders recognized that for the UN to maintain global peace, it must prevent direct conflict between the great powers themselves. The veto ensures that the Security Council cannot take enforcement action against one of the P5 or its close allies without its consent. This prevents a scenario where the UN is forced into a war against one of its most powerful members, which would likely lead to a catastrophic world war.

3.  **Reflecting Post-WWII Power Realities:** The veto power was a pragmatic acknowledgment of the distribution of power in 1945. The P5 were the victors of World War II and possessed the military and economic might to enforce or undermine any global security decision. The UN Charter institutionalized this reality, giving them a special responsibility and a special privilege to match.

In essence, the veto was not created based on principles of equality or democracy, but on a **pragmatic calculation** that the UN's effectiveness and survival depended on the collective agreement and cooperation of the world's most powerful states. It was seen as a necessary evil to create a durable, albeit imperfect, system for global security.

#### **(e) What is meant by multilateralism? Has its importance increased in the context of the current world situation?**

**Answer:**

**Multilateralism** is a principle in international relations that involves three or more states cooperating to solve common problems. It is characterized by adherence to shared norms and principles, institutionalized processes (like those in the UN or WTO), and a commitment to collective action rather than unilateral or bilateral approaches. It is the practice of coordinating national policies in groups of three or more states.

**Increased Importance in the Current World Situation:**
Yes, the importance of multilateralism has significantly increased in the context of today's interconnected world, precisely because the most pressing global challenges are transnational and cannot be solved by any single nation acting alone.

1.  **Global Pandemics:** The COVID-19 pandemic starkly illustrated the necessity of multilateral cooperation. Global health security requires coordinated efforts in disease surveillance (through the WHO), vaccine development and distribution (like the COVAX facility), and sharing of scientific data. Unilateral actions proved insufficient and often counterproductive.

2.  **Climate Change:** As an existential threat, climate change demands a global response. Multilateral frameworks like the **Paris Agreement** are the only viable means to coordinate emissions reductions, provide climate finance to developing nations, and manage the global transition to clean energy. No country can solve this crisis on its own.

3.  **Economic Stability and Trade:** In a deeply integrated global economy, financial crises and trade disputes have cascading effects. Multilateral institutions like the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** and the **World Trade Organization (WTO)** are crucial for maintaining financial stability, resolving trade conflicts, and setting the rules for global commerce, even if they are in need of reform.

4.  **Peace and Security:** While great power competition is rising, multilateral diplomacy remains essential for conflict resolution, arms control (like the NPT), and peacekeeping. It provides a platform for dialogue and de-escalation that can prevent regional conflicts from spiraling into global confrontations.

Despite facing challenges from rising nationalism and great power rivalry, the very nature of 21st-century problems—from pandemics to climate change to cyber threats—makes multilateralism more indispensable than ever.

#### **(f) What is meant by soft power? How realistic is its application in implementing state policy?**

**Answer:**

**Soft power**, a term coined by political scientist Joseph Nye, is the ability of a state to influence the preferences and behaviors of other actors in international relations through **attraction and persuasion** rather than coercion (hard power, i.e., military or economic force). A country's soft power is derived from three main sources:
*   Its **culture** (in places where it is attractive to others).
*   Its **political values** (when it lives up to them at home and abroad).
*   Its **foreign policies** (when they are seen as legitimate and having moral authority).

**Realism of its Application:**
The application of soft power is highly realistic and has become an essential component of modern statecraft, though it has its limitations.

**Realistic Applications:**
1.  **Public Diplomacy and Cultural Exchange:** States realistically apply soft power through cultural exports (e.g., Hollywood movies, K-Pop), educational exchange programs (like the Fulbright Program), and international broadcasting (like the BBC World Service). These initiatives build goodwill and foster a positive image of the country abroad.
2.  **Building Alliances and Coalitions:** A country with strong soft power finds it easier to build international coalitions and gain support in multilateral institutions. When a state's foreign policy is seen as legitimate, others are more willing to follow its lead. For example, the widespread international support for Ukraine against Russian aggression is partly due to the appeal of democratic values.
3.  **Enhancing Trade and Tourism:** The attractiveness of a country's culture and lifestyle can directly translate into economic benefits by boosting tourism and creating demand for its products.

**Limitations:**
1.  **Slow and Indirect:** Soft power is not a tool for immediate results. Building a positive reputation and cultural influence takes decades, and its effects are often indirect and difficult to measure.
2.  **Vulnerable to Hypocrisy:** A state's soft power is severely damaged when its actions contradict its professed values. For instance, U.S. soft power was undermined by the Abu Ghraib scandal and the invasion of Iraq.
3.  **Ineffective Against Hard Threats:** Soft power alone is insufficient to deter a determined adversary who is willing to use military force. It cannot stop tanks or prevent a military invasion.

**Conclusion:**
Soft power is a highly realistic and vital tool of state policy, but it is most effective when used in conjunction with hard power, in a strategy known as **"smart power."** It is not a replacement for military or economic strength but a crucial complement that can achieve objectives that coercion alone cannot.

#### **(g) What is a hybrid war? What is the goal of a hybrid war?**

**Answer:**

**Hybrid war** is a military strategy that blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare, and cyber warfare with other influencing methods, such as fake news, diplomacy, lawfare, and foreign electoral intervention. It is a sophisticated form of conflict that operates across multiple domains simultaneously to exploit an opponent's vulnerabilities.

Key characteristics include:
*   **Ambiguity and Deniability:** Actions are often designed to remain below the threshold of conventional war, making attribution difficult and creating confusion. The use of proxy forces, "little green men" (unmarked soldiers), and cyberattacks allows the aggressor state to maintain plausible deniability.
*   **Multi-Domain Operations:** It synchronizes a wide range of overt and covert tools, including military, political, economic, civilian, and informational instruments.
*   **Targeting the Whole of Society:** Hybrid warfare doesn't just target the military; it aims to disrupt and destabilize the entire society by eroding public trust, polarizing politics, damaging the economy, and spreading disinformation.

**The Goal of a Hybrid War:**
The ultimate goal of a hybrid war is to **achieve strategic objectives without resorting to a full-scale conventional military conflict.** The specific aims are:

1.  **Destabilize and Weaken the Adversary:** The primary goal is to undermine the political, social, and economic stability of a target state from within. By creating chaos and division, the aggressor weakens the opponent's ability to resist.
2.  **Achieve Geopolitical Aims with Plausible Deniability:** It allows an aggressor to achieve objectives, such as annexing territory or changing a neighboring government's political alignment, while avoiding the international condemnation and military retaliation that would follow a conventional invasion. Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea is a classic example.
3.  **Undermine Alliances:** Hybrid tactics are often used to sow discord within military alliances like NATO. By creating political division and doubt among member states through disinformation and political interference, an aggressor can weaken the alliance's collective resolve.
4.  **Control the Narrative:** A key objective is to manipulate information and dominate the narrative surrounding the conflict, both domestically and internationally, to legitimize the aggressor's actions and delegitimize the opponent.

#### **(h) What is a sanction? How much have the sanctions imposed by the West on Russia in the Russia-Ukraine war affected the country's economy?**

**Answer:**

A **sanction** is a penalty or coercive measure, typically economic or political, applied by one or more states against another state to persuade it to change its policy or behavior. Sanctions can include trade embargoes, asset freezes, travel bans, and financial restrictions. They are a tool of foreign policy used as an alternative to military force.

**Impact of Sanctions on Russia's Economy:**
The sanctions imposed by the West on Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine are among the most comprehensive ever levied against a major economy. Their impact has been significant, though Russia has shown resilience.

**Major Impacts:**
1.  **Financial Isolation:** Russia's largest banks were cut off from the SWIFT international payment system. The Central Bank of Russia had approximately half of its $640 billion in foreign currency reserves frozen, severely limiting its ability to support the ruble and the economy.
2.  **Technological Degradation:** Crucial sanctions have been those restricting Russia's access to advanced technology, particularly semiconductors and components needed for its military-industrial complex and other high-tech sectors. This is expected to have a severe long-term impact on its ability to produce modern weaponry and maintain its industries.
3.  **Contraction and Restructuring of the Economy:** The Russian economy initially contracted sharply. While it has since stabilized and returned to growth, this has been achieved by putting the economy on a "war footing," with massive increases in military spending. The civilian economy, however, is suffering from underinvestment and a brain drain as skilled workers have fled the country.
4.  **Loss of Key Energy Markets:** The European Union, previously Russia's largest customer for oil and gas, has drastically reduced its imports. While Russia has managed to redirect some of its oil exports to countries like China and India (often at discounted prices), the loss of the lucrative European gas market is largely permanent and represents a major long-term blow to its revenue.

**Conclusion:**
While the sanctions did not cause an immediate collapse of the Russian economy as some had hoped, they have successfully isolated it financially, are degrading its technological and military capabilities over the long term, and have forced a painful and costly restructuring away from its most important markets. The long-term effect is a significant weakening of Russia's economic potential.

#### **(i) What is meant by 'backdoor diplomacy'? Discuss briefly.**

**Answer:**

**Backdoor diplomacy**, also known as **Track II diplomacy**, refers to unofficial, non-governmental, and informal channels of communication and negotiation between parties in a conflict. It runs parallel to official, formal diplomacy (Track I diplomacy), which is conducted by government officials, diplomats, and heads of state.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Unofficial Participants:** Participants in backdoor diplomacy are typically academics, retired officials, civil society leaders, or other non-state actors who are not formally representing their governments.
*   **Confidentiality and Plausible Deniability:** These talks are conducted privately and away from public scrutiny. This confidentiality allows participants to explore creative solutions and make concessions without the political pressure of official negotiations. It also provides "plausible deniability" for governments, who can distance themselves from the outcomes if they are not favorable.
*   **Focus on Building Trust and Exploring Options:** The primary goal is not to sign binding agreements but to build trust, improve communication, and explore potential solutions that may be too politically sensitive for official channels.

**Brief Discussion:**
Backdoor diplomacy is a crucial tool in international relations, especially in conflicts where official relations have broken down or where there is deep-seated mistrust. For example, the initial breakthroughs in the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) were achieved through secret, backdoor negotiations in Norway. Similarly, it has been used in dialogues between the United States and Iran when formal diplomatic ties were severed. It serves as a vital complement to official diplomacy by creating an environment where new ideas can be tested and political groundwork can be laid for eventual formal agreements.

#### **(j) What is meant by 'food nationalism'? Why does it arise?**

**Answer:**

**Food nationalism** refers to a government policy where a country restricts its food exports in order to secure supplies for its own domestic population. It is an inward-looking protectionist measure where a nation prioritizes its own food security above international trade obligations and the needs of other countries. This is typically done by imposing export bans, quotas, or high tariffs on essential food commodities.

**Reasons for its Emergence:**
Food nationalism arises from a combination of real and perceived threats to a nation's food supply.

1.  **Global Supply Chain Disruptions:** Events that disrupt global supply chains, such as the **COVID-19 pandemic** or the **war in Ukraine** (which disrupted grain and sunflower oil supplies), can create panic and lead countries to hoard their food resources.
2.  **Domestic Production Shocks:** Poor harvests caused by extreme weather events (like droughts or floods) linked to climate change can drastically reduce a country's domestic food supply. To prevent shortages and price spikes at home, a government may ban exports. For example, India has at times restricted rice and wheat exports due to concerns about its domestic harvest.
3.  **Price Volatility and Inflation:** A sharp increase in global food prices can lead governments to restrict exports in an attempt to control domestic food price inflation and prevent social unrest among their populations.
4.  **Political Posturing:** In some cases, food nationalism can be used as a political tool to demonstrate that a government is taking decisive action to protect its citizens, even if the economic rationale is weak.

The danger of food nationalism is that it can create a vicious cycle. When one country restricts exports, it reduces the global supply, driving up prices further and prompting other countries to impose their own restrictions, ultimately worsening global food insecurity.

Of course. Here are the elaborated answers for the final questions from the "International Affairs" paper.

### **Question 2: Answer any three of the following questions (15x3=45)**

#### **(a) What is the reason for the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine? Do you think Russia is deliberately prolonging the war? Give your opinion.**

**Answer:**

The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which escalated into a full-scale invasion in February 2022, is a multifaceted conflict with deep historical roots and complex immediate causes.

**Reasons for the War:**
1.  **NATO Expansion:** From Russia's perspective, the eastward expansion of NATO since the end of the Cold War is a primary cause. Russia views NATO as a hostile military alliance and considers its expansion to include former Soviet bloc countries, and potentially Ukraine, as a direct threat to its security interests and a violation of post-Cold War understandings. President Putin has repeatedly framed the invasion as a defensive measure to prevent Ukraine from becoming a "springboard" for NATO aggression.

2.  **Ukraine's Geopolitical Alignment:** For Ukraine, the conflict is about its sovereign right to determine its own foreign policy and future. Following its independence in 1991, Ukraine has increasingly sought closer ties with the West, including the European Union and NATO. This pro-Western shift, especially after the 2014 Maidan Revolution which ousted a pro-Russian president, is seen by Moscow as a betrayal and a move that pulls Ukraine out of its historical sphere of influence.

3.  **Historical and Ideological Factors:** President Putin has promoted a historical narrative that questions the legitimacy of Ukrainian statehood, suggesting that modern Ukraine is an artificial creation of the Soviet era and that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people." This ideology provides a justification for reasserting Russian control over what it considers its historical lands.

4.  **The Donbas Conflict and Annexation of Crimea:** The current war is an escalation of the conflict that began in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatist forces in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The failure to implement the Minsk II peace accords created a frozen conflict that eventually boiled over.

**Opinion on Prolonging the War:**
In my opinion, Russia is not so much deliberately prolonging the war as it is **unable to achieve its initial objectives quickly**, forcing it into a protracted war of attrition.

Initially, Russia likely aimed for a swift "special military operation" to decapitate the Ukrainian government in Kyiv and install a pro-Russian regime. This failed due to fierce Ukrainian resistance, logistical failures, and significant Western military support for Ukraine.

Having failed in its maximalist goals, Russia's strategy shifted. It now appears to be engaged in a long war with several objectives:
*   **Consolidating Territorial Gains:** To fully occupy and annex the territories in eastern and southern Ukraine it currently holds.
*   **Exhausting Ukraine and its Western Allies:** To wear down Ukraine's military and exhaust the political and economic will of its Western partners to continue providing support. Russia is betting that its larger population and resource base will allow it to outlast Ukraine in a prolonged conflict.
*   **Forcing a Negotiated Settlement on its Terms:** By prolonging the war, Russia hopes to create a "new reality" on the ground that would force Ukraine to eventually accept a settlement that includes territorial concessions and neutrality.

Therefore, the prolongation of the war is less a deliberate initial choice and more a strategic adaptation to its initial military failures. Russia is now prepared to fight a long war because it sees no other path to achieving a version of victory.

#### **(b) According to which treaty signed between India and Bangladesh was the 'Joint Rivers Commission' established? Analyze the role of this commission in ensuring the fair share of water from the joint rivers for Bangladesh.**

**Answer:**

The **India-Bangladesh Joint Rivers Commission (JRC)** was established in **1972** as part of the broader framework of cooperation laid out in the **Indo-Bangladesh Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace**. While the treaty provided the overarching spirit, the JRC was formally established through a joint communiqué following a meeting between the water resources ministers of both countries. It was created to institutionalize cooperation on managing their shared water resources.

**Analysis of the JRC's Role:**
The JRC was established with the noble objective of ensuring the "most effective joint efforts in maximizing the benefits from common river systems." However, its role in securing a fair share of water for Bangladesh has been mixed, marked by some successes but also significant limitations.

**Successes and Positive Aspects:**
1.  **Institutional Framework:** The very existence of the JRC is a success. It provides a permanent, institutional platform for dialogue, data exchange, and technical discussions, preventing water issues from being solely politicized and allowing for expert-level engagement.
2.  **The Ganges Water Sharing Treaty (1996):** The JRC played a crucial background role in the technical studies and negotiations that led to the landmark 1996 Ganges Water Sharing Treaty. This treaty provides a 30-year formula for sharing the Ganges water at the Farakka Barrage during the dry season and is considered a major diplomatic achievement.
3.  **Data Sharing and Flood Forecasting:** The JRC has been relatively successful in facilitating the exchange of hydrological data, which is vital for flood forecasting and early warning systems in Bangladesh, helping to mitigate the impact of floods.

**Limitations and Failures:**
1.  **Lack of Mandate for Water Allocation:** The JRC is primarily an advisory body. It can conduct studies, make recommendations, and facilitate dialogue, but it **lacks the authority to make binding decisions on water allocation or to resolve disputes**. Major decisions on water sharing, like the Ganges Treaty, must be elevated to the highest political levels.
2.  **Failure on Teesta and Other Rivers:** The most significant failure has been the inability to finalize a water-sharing treaty for the Teesta River, a critical water source for northern Bangladesh. Despite years of discussions within the JRC, a treaty has been stalled due to internal Indian politics (the objection of the West Bengal state government). Similarly, no progress has been made on sharing agreements for 52 other common rivers.
3.  **Focus on Data Exchange over Management:** Critics argue that the JRC has often been reduced to a forum for exchanging data rather than a body for proactive, integrated river basin management. It has not been effective in addressing issues like upstream water diversion, pollution, or erosion.

**Conclusion:**
While the Joint Rivers Commission is an indispensable institutional mechanism for cooperation, its role in securing Bangladesh's fair share of water has been limited by its advisory nature and the overarching power of political will. It has been a facilitator for success (Ganges Treaty) but has been unable to overcome political deadlocks on its own (Teesta River). For Bangladesh to secure its water rights, the JRC's technical work must be complemented by sustained, high-level political and diplomatic engagement.

#### **(d) Is the current political crisis in Myanmar a threat to regional security? Give arguments in support of your answer.**

**Answer:**

Yes, the current political crisis in Myanmar, which began with the military coup in February 2021, is unequivocally a significant and growing threat to regional security. The collapse of the state into a widespread civil war has created a vortex of instability with serious cross-border implications.

**Arguments Supporting this View:**

1.  **Humanitarian Crisis and Refugee Outflows:** The military junta's brutal crackdown on dissent and its indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations have created a massive humanitarian crisis. This has led to the internal displacement of over 2 million people and has forced tens of thousands to flee across the borders into neighboring countries like **Thailand** and **India**. This places a severe strain on the resources and social stability of these host nations and risks creating a protracted refugee crisis, similar to the Rohingya situation with Bangladesh.

2.  **Rise of Transnational Crime and Illicit Economies:** The breakdown of state control, particularly in Myanmar's border regions, has created a lawless environment where transnational criminal organizations thrive. The region has become a global hub for **drug production (methamphetamine and opium)**, **human trafficking**, and a proliferation of **online scam centers** that prey on victims across Southeast Asia and beyond. These criminal networks destabilize the entire region and pose a direct security threat to neighboring countries.

3.  **Spillover of Armed Conflict:** The conflict is not contained within Myanmar's borders. The junta's forces have conducted airstrikes and shelling near the Thai and Indian borders, occasionally with munitions landing in foreign territory. Furthermore, the flow of small arms and the movement of various ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) across porous borders create a direct risk of conflict spillover, potentially drawing neighboring states into the fray.

4.  **Destabilization of ASEAN:** The crisis has severely undermined the credibility and unity of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The bloc's inability to enforce its own "Five-Point Consensus" plan has exposed deep divisions within the organization, weakening its role as the central pillar of the regional security architecture. This failure to manage a crisis in its own backyard erodes regional stability.

5.  **Proxy for Great Power Competition:** The crisis risks becoming another arena for great power competition. While Western nations have sanctioned the junta, Russia and China have provided it with diplomatic cover and military support. This geopolitical rivalry could further entrench the conflict and make a peaceful resolution even more difficult, turning Myanmar into a fractured proxy battleground that destabilizes the wider Indo-Pacific.

In conclusion, the implosion of Myanmar is far from a purely domestic issue. It is a regional security crisis that is exporting instability, crime, and human suffering, with profound and dangerous implications for all its neighbors and the broader international community.
