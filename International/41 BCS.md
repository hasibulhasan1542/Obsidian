### **Question 01: Write short answers: (4x10=40)**

#### **(a) Write about the concept of Islamophobia.**

**Answer:**
**Islamophobia** is the prejudice, discrimination, fear, or hatred directed against Muslims or Islam. It manifests as a form of racism and religious intolerance, where Islam is often stereotyped as a monolithic, static, and inherently violent religion, inferior to Western culture, and a political ideology rather than a faith.

The concept gained prominence after the September 11, 2001 attacks, but its roots are much older. Islamophobia operates on multiple levels:
*   **Individual Level:** It can manifest as verbal abuse, harassment, and physical violence against individuals who are, or are perceived to be, Muslim.
*   **Institutional Level:** It can be seen in discriminatory state policies, such as profiling at airports, surveillance of Muslim communities, and biased media coverage that disproportionately links Islam with terrorism.
*   **Cultural Level:** It involves the widespread dissemination of negative stereotypes through media, political rhetoric, and popular culture, which dehumanizes Muslims and normalizes prejudice against them.

International bodies like the UN have recognized Islamophobia as a serious global issue. In 2022, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution designating **March 15** as the **International Day to Combat Islamophobia**, calling for a global dialogue to promote a culture of tolerance and peace.

#### **(b) What do you understand by vaccine diplomacy?**

**Answer:**
**Vaccine diplomacy** refers to the use of vaccines as a tool of foreign policy, where countries leverage the development, production, and distribution of vaccines to strengthen bilateral relationships, enhance their geopolitical influence, and promote their national interests. It is a modern form of soft power, particularly prominent during global health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries engage in vaccine diplomacy in several ways:
1.  **Donations and Sales:** Donating or selling vaccines to other nations, especially developing countries, to build goodwill and create diplomatic leverage. For example, China's "Health Silk Road" involved distributing its Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines globally.
2.  **Shaping Global Narratives:** Using vaccine distribution to project an image of being a responsible and benevolent global power, thereby enhancing its international reputation.
3.  **Strengthening Alliances:** Prioritizing vaccine supplies for strategic allies and partners to solidify existing relationships.
4.  **Countering Rivals:** Competing with rival nations to be the primary vaccine supplier to a particular region, thereby expanding one's sphere of influence.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the world witnessed intense vaccine diplomacy, with major powers like China, Russia (with its Sputnik V vaccine), India (with its "Vaccine Maitri" initiative), and the United States using their vaccine capabilities to pursue foreign policy goals.

#### **(d) What should Bangladesh do to graduate from the LDC category?**

**Answer:**
Bangladesh has already met all three criteria for graduation from the Least Developed Country (LDC) category for the second consecutive time in 2021 and is officially scheduled to graduate in **November 2026**. To ensure this transition is smooth, sustainable, and successful, Bangladesh must take several crucial steps:

The three criteria met were:
1.  **Gross National Income (GNI) per capita:** Bangladesh's GNI per capita exceeded the threshold of $1,222.
2.  **Human Assets Index (HAI):** The country surpassed the threshold of 66, indicating strong progress in health and education.
3.  **Economic and Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI):** Bangladesh's score was well below the threshold of 32, showing increased economic resilience.

**Steps Bangladesh Must Take for a Sustainable Graduation:**
1.  **Secure Preferential Market Access:** Upon graduation, Bangladesh will lose its duty-free, quota-free access to many developed markets, including the EU. A top priority is to negotiate new trade agreements, such as the EU's **GSP+ (Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus)**, which requires compliance with international conventions on human rights, labor rights, and environmental protection.
2.  **Export Diversification:** The economy's heavy reliance on the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) sector (over 80% of exports) is a major vulnerability. The government must aggressively promote diversification into other sectors like pharmaceuticals, leather goods, software/IT services, and light engineering to build a more resilient export base.
3.  **Enhance Domestic Resource Mobilization:** LDC graduation will also reduce access to concessional loans and some forms of development aid. To compensate, Bangladesh must improve its domestic resource mobilization by expanding its tax base, improving tax administration, and reforming its revenue collection system.
4.  **Attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):** The country needs to improve its business climate, streamline regulations, and develop infrastructure to attract more FDI, which will be crucial for technology transfer, job creation, and economic growth post-graduation.
5.  **Strengthen Competitiveness:** Bangladesh must enhance the productivity and competitiveness of its industries by investing in skills development, technology adoption, and infrastructure to compete in the global market without the crutch of preferential treatment.

#### **(f) Discuss the concept of the 'shadow pandemic'.**

**Answer:**
The term **"shadow pandemic"** refers to the global surge in **domestic violence and violence against women and girls** that occurred in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the world's attention was focused on the health crisis, a secondary, hidden crisis of gender-based violence was escalating dramatically.

The main drivers of this shadow pandemic were the public health measures implemented to control the spread of the virus:
*   **Lockdowns and Stay-at-Home Orders:** These measures trapped many women and children at home with their abusers, isolating them from their support networks and making it harder to seek help.
*   **Economic Stress:** Widespread job losses, financial insecurity, and economic hardship increased household stress and tensions, which are known triggers for domestic violence.
*   **Disruption of Services:** Support services for survivors of violence, such as shelters, hotlines, and legal aid, were either shut down, overwhelmed, or difficult to access due to movement restrictions.
*   **Increased Caregiver Burden:** Women disproportionately shouldered the burden of unpaid care work, including childcare during school closures and caring for sick family members, which added to their stress and vulnerability.

UN Women and other international organizations reported a significant increase in calls to domestic violence hotlines in many countries during the pandemic. The term "shadow pandemic" powerfully highlights how crises can exacerbate pre-existing gender inequalities and create hidden layers of suffering that demand urgent attention and policy responses.

#### **(h) What is meant by most-favored-nation (MFN) in international trade?**

**Answer:**
**Most-Favored-Nation (MFN)** is a fundamental principle of international trade and a cornerstone of the **World Trade Organization (WTO)** agreement. It is a status or level of treatment accorded by one state to another in international trade.

The MFN principle requires a country to grant any trade advantage, favor, privilege, or immunity that it gives to one country to all other WTO member countries immediately and unconditionally. In simple terms, if a country grants a special favor to one trading partner (such as a lower tariff rate on a particular product), it must do the same for all other WTO members.

**Key Points:**
*   **Non-Discrimination:** The essence of the MFN principle is non-discrimination between trading partners. It ensures that all countries are treated equally.
*   **Exceptions:** There are some exceptions to the MFN rule. The most significant is for **Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)** and **Customs Unions** (like the European Union), where member countries can grant each other preferential treatment that they do not extend to outside countries. Special treatment for developing countries is also permitted.
*   **Purpose:** The goal of the MFN principle is to promote fairer and more efficient trade by eliminating trade discrimination, simplifying trade rules, and creating a more stable and predictable international trading system.

Despite its name, MFN does not mean one country is the "most favored"; rather, it means it is treated equally with all other "most favored" nations.

#### **(j) Discuss how the world is moving towards the concept of a blue or ocean economy.**

**Answer:**
The world is increasingly moving towards the concept of a **blue or ocean economy** due to a convergence of economic necessity, technological advancement, and a growing recognition of the ocean's critical role in sustainable development.

This global shift is driven by several factors:
1.  **Depletion of Land-Based Resources:** As land-based resources become scarcer and more expensive to extract, nations are turning to the ocean as a new frontier for resources. This includes everything from fish stocks and minerals to energy reserves.
2.  **Technological Advancements:** New technologies are making it possible to explore and exploit ocean resources in ways that were previously unimaginable. This includes deep-sea drilling technology, advanced aquaculture systems, offshore renewable energy platforms (wind, wave, tidal), and marine biotechnology.
3.  **Growing Global Demand:** The world's growing population requires more food, energy, and raw materials. The ocean offers vast potential to meet these demands. For example, sustainable aquaculture is seen as a key solution to global food security.
4.  **Climate Change and Sustainability:** There is a growing awareness that the health of the ocean is inextricably linked to the health of the planet. The ocean is a massive carbon sink and regulates global climate. The blue economy concept, therefore, emphasizes sustainability, seeking to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation. This has led to a focus on green shipping, marine conservation, and tackling ocean pollution.
5.  **New Economic Frontiers:** The ocean is now seen as a source of new industries and high-value economic activities. Marine biotechnology, for example, is exploring marine organisms for new pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes.

International institutions like the **World Bank** and the **United Nations** are actively promoting the blue economy as a key pillar of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly **SDG 14 (Life Below Water)**. This global push is encouraging nations to develop national strategies to sustainably harness their marine resources for long-term prosperity.

### **Question 02**

#### **(c) Prepare a work plan for a long-term solution to the Rohingya problem.**

**Answer:**

A long-term, sustainable solution to the Rohingya crisis requires a multi-pronged, phased work plan that addresses the root causes of the conflict in Myanmar while managing the immediate humanitarian situation in Bangladesh. The plan must involve bilateral, regional, and international efforts.

**A Phased Work Plan for a Sustainable Solution:**

**Phase 1: Immediate to Short-Term (1-2 Years) - Stabilization and Preparation**
*   **Humanitarian Support and Security in Camps (Bangladesh):** Continue providing essential humanitarian aid (food, shelter, health) in the Cox's Bazar camps, with increased international funding. Enhance security within the camps to curb the activities of criminal gangs and extremist groups.
*   **Skills Development and Education:** Implement a comprehensive education program in the camps using the Myanmar curriculum, and provide vocational and skills training for adults. This prepares the Rohingya for reintegration and prevents a "lost generation."
*   **Pressure on Myanmar for Ceasefire:** The UN and ASEAN must intensify pressure on the Myanmar junta to cease all violence in Rakhine State and create a secure environment. This is a non-negotiable first step.
*   **Third-Country Resettlement:** For a limited number of the most vulnerable refugees, pursue resettlement options in third countries like the US, Canada, and Australia to alleviate some pressure on Bangladesh.

**Phase 2: Medium-Term (2-5 Years) - Confidence Building and Pilot Repatriation**
*   **Verification and Dialogue:** Under UNHCR supervision, begin a transparent and voluntary verification process to identify Rohingya willing to return. Initiate direct dialogue between Rohingya community representatives and the Myanmar authorities (ideally a future legitimate government) to build trust.
*   **Creation of "Safe Zones" in Rakhine:** With international monitoring (potentially an ASEAN or UN-mandated civilian observer mission), establish internationally verified "safe zones" in northern Rakhine State where basic infrastructure (housing, schools, clinics) is rebuilt.
*   **Pilot Repatriation:** Begin a small-scale, voluntary pilot repatriation project to these safe zones. The success of this pilot will be crucial for building confidence for larger-scale returns. The process must be voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable, with UNHCR having full access to monitor the conditions of the returnees.
*   **Justice and Accountability:** Actively support the ongoing cases at the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** and the **International Criminal Court (ICC)** to ensure accountability for the genocide and crimes against humanity. Justice is a key component of a sustainable solution.

**Phase 3: Long-Term (5+ Years) - Reintegration and Root Cause Resolution**
*   **Full-Scale Repatriation:** Based on the success of the pilot phase, scale up the voluntary repatriation process.
*   **Addressing the Root Causes (Myanmar):** This is the most critical and difficult step. A permanent solution requires fundamental changes within Myanmar itself:
    *   **Granting Citizenship:** Repeal the discriminatory 1982 Citizenship Law and grant the Rohingya full citizenship rights.
    *   **Ensuring Freedom of Movement and Livelihoods:** Restore the Rohingya's freedom of movement and access to land, education, and employment.
    *   **Political Reconciliation:** Support a transition to a federal democracy in Myanmar that guarantees the rights and autonomy of all ethnic minorities, including the Rohingya.

This comprehensive work plan acknowledges that there is no quick fix. It requires sustained diplomatic pressure, international solidarity, and a fundamental political transformation within Myanmar to resolve one of the most tragic and protracted crises of our time.

### **Question 02**

#### **(a) Discuss the potential impact of the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan on regional and international politics.**

**Answer:**

The withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan in August 2021, culminating in the swift collapse of the Afghan government and the return of the Taliban to power, has had a profound and destabilizing impact on regional and international politics.

**Impact on Regional Politics:**

1. **Empowerment of Regional Terrorist Groups:** The Taliban's victory has emboldened other extremist and terrorist groups in the region, such as **Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)** and Al-Qaeda affiliates. Afghanistan has once again become a potential safe haven for these groups, posing a direct security threat to neighboring countries, especially **Pakistan**, **Iran**, and the Central Asian states (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan).
    
2. **Humanitarian and Refugee Crisis:** The collapse of the Afghan economy and the Taliban's repressive policies have created a severe humanitarian crisis, leading to mass internal displacement and a new wave of refugees seeking shelter in neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan and Iran, placing immense strain on their resources.
    
3. **Shifting Regional Power Dynamics:** The withdrawal created a power vacuum. Regional powers like **Pakistan**, **Iran**, **China**, and **Russia** have increased their engagement with the Taliban government to protect their security interests and vie for influence, creating a new, complex geopolitical dynamic in the region.
    
4. **Increase in Illicit Drug Trade:** With the collapse of the formal economy, Afghanistan's role as the world's largest producer of opium and a major source of methamphetamine has intensified, fueling transnational crime and instability across the region.
    

**Impact on International Politics:**

1. **Damage to US Credibility:** The chaotic nature of the withdrawal and the rapid collapse of the government it had supported for 20 years dealt a significant blow to the credibility and reliability of the United States as a global partner and security guarantor. Allies and adversaries alike questioned US resolve.
    
2. **End of the "Nation-Building" Era:** The failure in Afghanistan marked the symbolic end of the two-decade-long post-9/11 era of large-scale Western military interventions aimed at nation-building and promoting democracy. It has led to a more cautious and less interventionist foreign policy approach in the West.
    
3. **Shift in US Strategic Focus:** The withdrawal allowed the United States to pivot its strategic focus and resources away from counter-terrorism in the Middle East and South Asia towards what it perceives as the primary long-term challenge: **great power competition with China and Russia**.
    
4. **Human Rights and Women's Rights Setback:** The return of the Taliban has resulted in a catastrophic rollback of human rights, particularly for women and girls, who have been systematically excluded from education, employment, and public life. This has created a major normative challenge for the international community.

#### **(b) Experts have opined that there is no possibility of Bangladesh falling into a debt trap by joining the 'Belt and Road Initiative'. Discuss with comments.**

**Answer:**

The opinion that Bangladesh is unlikely to fall into a "debt trap" by joining China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a well-founded and credible assessment, based on the country's prudent debt management strategy and the nature of its loan portfolio. I agree with this expert opinion.

**Discussion and Comments:**

1. **Diversified Debt Portfolio:** A key reason Bangladesh is not at high risk is that its foreign debt is not overwhelmingly concentrated with a single lender. While China is a major development partner, Bangladesh's largest lenders are multilateral institutions like the **World Bank**, the **Asian Development Bank (ADB)**, and Japan (through **JICA**). These institutions provide loans on highly **concessional** (soft) terms with low interest rates and long repayment periods. As of 2023, loans from China constituted a relatively small portion (around 6-8%) of Bangladesh's total external debt stock.
    
2. **Prudent Government Policy and Project Selection:** Unlike countries like Sri Lanka, which took on high-interest commercial loans for projects with questionable economic viability (e.g., Hambantota Port), Bangladesh has generally been more cautious. The government primarily seeks concessional financing and conducts feasibility studies to ensure that the projects it undertakes, such as the Padma Bridge Rail Link or the Karnaphuli Tunnel, will generate sufficient economic returns to service the debt.
    
3. **Strong and Stable Macroeconomic Management:** Bangladesh has maintained a strong track record of macroeconomic stability for over a decade, with consistent GDP growth, stable inflation (prior to recent global shocks), and a healthy debt-to-GDP ratio. The country's debt-to-GDP ratio remains well below the international cautionary threshold of 55-60%, indicating that its debt level is sustainable.
    
4. **Learning from Others' Mistakes:** Bangladeshi policymakers are acutely aware of the "debt-trap diplomacy" narrative and the cautionary tale of Sri Lanka. This has reinforced a conservative approach to borrowing, with a clear preference for concessional financing over more expensive commercial loans from any source.
    

**Conclusion:**  
While any large-scale borrowing carries risks that must be managed carefully, the structure of Bangladesh's external debt, its policy of prioritizing concessional loans, and its strong macroeconomic fundamentals provide a solid defense against the risk of a Chinese (or any other) debt trap. The assertion by experts that Bangladesh is not on a path to a debt crisis due to its participation in the BRI is, therefore, a realistic and well-supported analysis.

### **Question 03: In the context of the recent situation in India's Assam state, where a process has been initiated to officially identify so-called illegal Bangladeshis, prepare a policy paper for Bangladesh.**

**Answer:**

**Policy Paper: A Proactive Diplomatic and Humanitarian Strategy for Bangladesh in Response to the NRC/CAA Issue in Assam**

**To:** Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh  
**From:** [Your Title/Department]  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Subject:** A Strategic Policy Framework Regarding the Citizenship Issue in Assam and its Implications for Bangladesh

**1. Introduction and Situational Analysis:**  
The process of updating the **National Register of Citizens (NRC)** in the Indian state of Assam, which excluded 1.9 million people, and the subsequent enactment of the **Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA)** by the Government of India have created significant political and humanitarian concerns for Bangladesh. Although India has repeatedly assured Bangladesh that this is an "internal matter," the situation has the potential to directly impact Bangladesh through the risk of cross-border displacement and by straining bilateral relations. This policy paper outlines a proactive, multi-pronged strategy to safeguard Bangladesh's national interests.

**2. Core Policy Stance:**  
Bangladesh's official and unwavering position must be that **there are no "illegal Bangladeshis" in Assam**. The issue is a result of complex historical and internal political dynamics within India. Bangladesh has no legal or moral obligation to accept any person declared stateless by the Indian process. This position must be communicated consistently and firmly through all diplomatic channels.

**3. Strategic Policy Pillars:**

**Pillar I: Proactive Diplomatic Engagement**

- **High-Level Dialogue with India:** Continue and intensify dialogue with the central government in New Delhi at the highest levels (Prime Ministerial, Foreign Ministerial). The objective is to secure a clear, public, and unequivocal reaffirmation from India that no person will be pushed across the border into Bangladesh.
    
- **Engagement with West Bengal:** Given its shared border and cultural ties, engage in quiet diplomacy with the state government of West Bengal to ensure border stability and to prevent the issue from creating regional tensions.
    
- **Multilateral Advocacy:** While maintaining the primacy of bilateral engagement, subtly raise the humanitarian and human rights dimensions of the issue in relevant international forums like the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and with international human rights organizations. Frame it as an issue of potential statelessness, which is a global concern.
    

**Pillar II: Strengthened Border Management and Security**

- **Enhanced Border Surveillance:** Increase the vigilance and capacity of the **Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB)** along the Assam and West Bengal borders. This includes enhancing technological surveillance (drones, sensors) and increasing patrols to prevent any "push-in" attempts.
    
- **Joint Border Coordination:** Strengthen coordination mechanisms with India's Border Security Force (BSF) through regular flag meetings to immediately address and de-escalate any border incidents related to attempted deportations.
    

**Pillar III: Public Diplomacy and Narrative Management**

- **Clear Domestic and International Communication:** The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should maintain a clear and consistent public narrative. It should highlight Bangladesh's strong record on humanitarianism (e.g., the Rohingya crisis) while firmly reiterating that it cannot and will not accept any new refugee burden.
    
- **Engage Global Media and Think Tanks:** Proactively engage with international media, academic institutions, and think tanks to present Bangladesh's perspective and counter any narrative that seeks to shift the burden of this internal Indian issue onto Bangladesh.
    

**4. Conclusion and Recommendation:**  
The citizenship issue in Assam represents a significant potential challenge to Bangladesh's national security and diplomatic relations. A strategy that combines firm but quiet diplomacy with India, strengthened border security, and proactive narrative management is the most effective way to protect Bangladesh's interests and prevent a humanitarian crisis on its borders. The guiding principle must be the non-negotiable position that this is an internal matter of India, and Bangladesh will not be a party to its consequences.
