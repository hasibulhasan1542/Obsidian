### **01. Brief Answers (4x10=40)**

**(a) Write about the concept of Islamophobia.**

Islamophobia is the irrational fear of, hatred of, or prejudice against the religion of Islam or Muslims in general. It often manifests as discrimination, hostility, and negative stereotyping in both individual attitudes and systemic practices.

Key aspects include:
*   **Stereotyping:** It involves generalizing the actions of a small extremist minority to over a billion Muslims, commonly linking the entire religion to terrorism and violence.
*   **Manifestations:** It can range from individual acts of verbal abuse and physical attacks to systemic discrimination in employment, housing, and government policies (e.g., surveillance of Muslim communities, travel bans).
*   **Media and Political Rhetoric:** Islamophobia is often fueled and amplified by negative media portrayals and the political rhetoric of populist leaders who use anti-Muslim sentiment for political gain.
It is widely considered a contemporary form of racism and xenophobia that creates social division and threatens the safety and civil rights of Muslim communities worldwide.

**(b) What do you understand by vaccine diplomacy?**

Vaccine diplomacy is the use of the development, distribution, or supply of vaccines as a tool to advance a country's foreign policy goals and geopolitical influence. It is a form of soft power where providing life-saving medical aid is used to build goodwill, strengthen bilateral relationships, and enhance a nation's global standing.

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a clear example. Countries like China (through its "Health Silk Road") and India (through its "Vaccine Maitri" initiative) used their vaccine production capacity to supply doses to countries across the developing world, thereby strengthening diplomatic ties and positioning themselves as responsible global leaders. Similarly, Western nations channeled their support through the multilateral COVAX facility. Vaccine diplomacy can thus be a tool for both cooperation and geopolitical competition.

**(c) How relevant is the collective security system in the current global context?**

The collective security system, where an attack on one state is considered an attack on all, remains a cornerstone of international peace architecture, primarily embodied in the UN Charter. However, its relevance in the current global context is mixed and contested.

*   **Relevance:** The principle still provides the legal and moral foundation for international action against aggression (e.g., the response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990-91). It serves as a deterrent and a framework for mobilizing global coalitions.
*   **Limitations:** Its effectiveness is severely hampered by the political realities of the UN Security Council. The **veto power** of the permanent five (P5) members often leads to deadlock and inaction, especially when a P5 member's own interests are at stake (as seen in the crises in Syria and Ukraine). This means the system often fails to work when it is needed most.

In essence, while the *idea* of collective security is highly relevant, its practical application is often paralyzed by great power politics.

**(d) What does Bangladesh need to do to graduate from the LDC category?**

To graduate from the Least Developed Country (LDC) category, Bangladesh must meet the criteria set by the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP) and, more importantly, ensure that this progress is sustainable. Bangladesh has already met the three required criteria for graduation in two consecutive triennial reviews (2018 and 2021):

1.  **Gross National Income (GNI) per capita:** A measure of income.
2.  **Human Assets Index (HAI):** A measure of health and education.
3.  **Economic and Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI):** A measure of structural vulnerability to shocks.

The key task for Bangladesh now is to prepare for a smooth and sustainable transition post-graduation (scheduled for 2026). This involves:
*   **Economic Diversification:** Reducing over-reliance on the RMG sector and developing other export-oriented industries to compensate for the potential loss of preferential trade benefits (like the EU's Everything But Arms scheme).
*   **Strengthening Domestic Resource Mobilization:** Improving tax collection and expanding the tax base to offset any potential decline in foreign aid.
*   **Improving Competitiveness:** Enhancing productivity, improving infrastructure, and creating a better business environment to attract investment.
*   **Building Climate Resilience:** Continuing to invest in climate adaptation measures to manage environmental vulnerabilities.

**(e) Discuss the concept of 'anarchical society' in international relations.**

The concept of an "anarchical society" is a central idea of the English School of international relations theory, most associated with scholar Hedley Bull. It describes a fundamental paradox in the international system.

*   **Anarchy:** It acknowledges the realist view that the international system is anarchical, meaning there is no overarching world government or central authority above sovereign states.
*   **Society:** However, it argues that this anarchy does not lead to constant, pure chaos. States, despite their independence, have formed a "society of states" by developing a set of shared rules, norms, and institutions to manage their relations.

These shared institutions include diplomacy, international law, the principle of sovereignty, and the balance of power. They create a degree of order and predictability, making international politics a social, rather than purely mechanical, activity. The term "anarchical society" thus captures this complex reality of a system that lacks a central ruler but is not without rules.

**(f) Discuss the 'Shadow Pandemic'.**

The term "shadow pandemic" was used by the United Nations and other organizations to refer to the global surge in violence against women and girls, particularly domestic violence, that occurred during the lockdowns and restrictions imposed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was called a "shadow" pandemic because it was a secondary crisis happening behind closed doors, largely invisible to the public eye. The key contributing factors were:
*   **Lockdowns and Isolation:** Women were trapped at home with their abusers, isolated from their social support networks.
*   **Economic Stress:** Job losses and financial insecurity increased tensions within households.
*   **Disruption of Services:** Access to support services, shelters, and legal aid was severely restricted.

The shadow pandemic highlighted how public health crises can exacerbate existing social inequalities and gender-based violence.

**(g) What are the devastating effects of extreme weather?**

Extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, have a wide range of devastating effects:

1.  **Humanitarian Impacts:** They cause significant loss of life, injuries, and displacement of populations. Floods, storms, and heatwaves can create massive humanitarian crises.
2.  **Economic Impacts:** They destroy critical infrastructure (roads, bridges, power grids), damage property, and disrupt economic activity, leading to enormous financial losses for individuals, businesses, and governments.
3.  **Impact on Food and Water Security:** Droughts and floods can lead to widespread crop failure and loss of livestock, threatening food security. They can also contaminate water sources and lead to water scarcity.
4.  **Environmental Impacts:** They can cause irreversible damage to ecosystems, leading to loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and desertification.

**(h) What is meant by Most Favoured Nation in international trade?**

Most Favoured Nation (MFN) is a fundamental principle of non-discrimination in international trade and a cornerstone of the World Trade Organization (WTO) system. It requires a country to grant any trade advantage, privilege, or immunity it gives to one WTO member country to **all other WTO members** immediately and unconditionally.

Contrary to what the name suggests, MFN does not mean giving one country special treatment. Instead, it ensures **equal treatment** for all trading partners. For example, if a country lowers its import tariff on a product from one country, it must apply the same lower tariff to that product from all other WTO members. This promotes fair competition and a more liberal global trading system.

**(i) What is the policy of 'humanitarian intervention' in international politics?**

Humanitarian intervention is the controversial policy of using military force by a state or group of states in the territory of another state, without its permission, with the stated goal of ending or preventing gross violations of human rights, such as genocide or crimes against humanity.

*   **Core Dilemma:** It presents a direct clash between two fundamental principles of international relations: the principle of **state sovereignty** (non-interference in internal affairs) and the responsibility to protect fundamental human rights.
*   **Modern Framework (R2P):** The concept has evolved into the "Responsibility to Protect" (R2P) doctrine, which holds that sovereignty is not an absolute right but a responsibility. R2P suggests that if a state is "manifestly failing" to protect its population from mass atrocities, the international community has a responsibility to intervene, with military force being an absolute last resort authorized by the UN Security Council.

**(j) Discuss how the world is advancing towards the concept of a blue or ocean economy.**

The world is increasingly advancing towards the concept of a blue economy, driven by a growing recognition of both the immense economic potential of the oceans and the urgent need to protect them. This shift is marked by several key trends:

1.  **Recognition of Economic Potential:** There is a growing awareness that oceans hold vast resources beyond traditional fishing. Key growth sectors include marine renewable energy (offshore wind, tidal), marine biotechnology, sustainable aquaculture, and eco-tourism.
2.  **Focus on Sustainability:** The traditional "brown" model of simply extracting ocean resources is being replaced by the "blue" model, which emphasizes sustainability. This is driven by the alarming decline in ocean health due to overfishing, pollution, and climate change.
3.  **International Policy Frameworks:** The concept is being integrated into global agendas. The United Nations' **Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water)** explicitly calls for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources.
4.  **Technological Advancement:** New technologies are making it possible to explore and exploit ocean resources in more sustainable ways, from advanced aquaculture techniques to the development of offshore renewable energy platforms.

This global shift represents a move towards managing the oceans not just as a space for exploitation, but as a vital ecosystem that must be preserved for future economic growth and planetary health.

### **02. Answer any three of the following questions (15x3=45)**

**(a) Discuss the potential impact of the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan on regional and international politics.**

The withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan in August 2021, culminating in the swift collapse of the Afghan government and the return of the Taliban to power, has profoundly reshaped the political landscape of the region and the world. Its impacts are far-reaching and multifaceted.

**Impact on Regional Politics:**

1.  **Empowerment of Pakistan and Regional Instability:** Pakistan has long been accused of providing sanctuary and support to the Taliban. The Taliban's victory is widely seen as a major strategic victory for Pakistan, granting it significant influence in Kabul. However, this has also created new security challenges for Pakistan itself, with the emboldened Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) increasing its attacks within Pakistani territory.
2.  **Increased Security Concerns for Neighbors:** Afghanistan's neighbors, particularly the Central Asian republics (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan), Iran, and India, face heightened security threats. They are concerned about:
    *   **The spillover of instability and extremism** across their borders.
    *   **An increase in transnational terrorism**, as Afghanistan could once again become a safe haven for international terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS-K.
    *   **A surge in refugee flows** and an increase in illicit drug trafficking.
3.  **A Setback for India:** The Taliban's return is a major strategic setback for India, which had invested heavily in the previous Afghan government. India has lost its influence in Kabul and now faces a hostile regime with close ties to its arch-rival, Pakistan.
4.  **New Diplomatic Role for China and Russia:** The US withdrawal has created a power vacuum that China and Russia are seeking to fill. Both countries have engaged diplomatically with the Taliban, seeking to secure their own strategic interests, protect their borders from instability, and expand their influence in the region.

**Impact on International Politics:**

1.  **Damage to US Credibility and Prestige:** The chaotic and hasty nature of the withdrawal, and the rapid collapse of the government it had supported for 20 years, dealt a severe blow to the credibility of the United States as a reliable ally and a global power. It raised questions among allies worldwide about the steadfastness of US security commitments.
2.  **End of the "Nation-Building" Era:** The failure in Afghanistan has led to a significant shift in US foreign policy, marking the end of the post-9/11 era of large-scale military interventions aimed at nation-building and promoting democracy. The focus has shifted towards great power competition with China and Russia.
3.  **Humanitarian Crisis and Loss of Human Rights:** The withdrawal led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, with the economy collapsing and millions facing starvation. The progress made over 20 years, particularly in the rights of women and girls, was almost instantly erased by the Taliban's repressive policies.
4.  **Resurgence of Global Terrorist Threats:** The primary concern for the international community is that Afghanistan under the Taliban will once again become a sanctuary for global terrorist groups to plan and launch attacks against other countries, repeating the conditions that led to the 9/11 attacks.

In conclusion, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan was a seismic event that not only ended America's longest war but also triggered a new era of instability and geopolitical realignment in South and Central Asia, while simultaneously challenging the foundations of US global leadership.

**(b) Experts have opined that there is no possibility of Bangladesh falling into a debt trap by joining the 'Belt and Road Initiative'. Discuss with comments.**

The assertion by experts that Bangladesh is unlikely to fall into a "debt trap" by joining China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a credible and well-founded argument, based on the country's prudent economic management and strategic approach to infrastructure financing. While concerns about BRI-related debt are valid globally, Bangladesh's specific situation suggests a low risk.

**Arguments Supporting the View (Why Bangladesh is not at risk):**

1.  **Prudent Debt Management:** Bangladesh has a long and successful track record of maintaining a sustainable level of public debt. The country's debt-to-GDP ratio has consistently been kept at a manageable level (around 40%), which is well below the international benchmark for high risk. The government has historically been cautious about taking on non-concessional loans.
2.  **Diversified Portfolio of Lenders:** Bangladesh's development financing is not overly reliant on any single country. Its primary development partners have traditionally been multilateral institutions like the **World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)**. These institutions provide loans on highly concessional terms (low interest rates, long repayment periods). Chinese loans, while significant, constitute only a fraction of Bangladesh's total external debt portfolio.
3.  **Strategic Project Selection:** The government of Bangladesh has exercised significant agency in selecting which projects to finance under the BRI. It has prioritized projects that are economically viable and have the potential to generate sufficient returns to service the debt, such as the Padma Bridge Rail Link and the Karnaphuli Tunnel. It has also rejected or renegotiated projects that were deemed economically unfeasible or had unfavorable loan terms.
4.  **Strong and Growing Economy:** Bangladesh's robust economic growth over the past decade provides a strong capacity to service its debt. A consistently growing GDP, rising export earnings, and stable foreign exchange reserves create a buffer that makes the country resilient to debt-related shocks. The case of Sri Lanka, often cited as a cautionary tale, involved a combination of unsustainable borrowing, economic mismanagement, and sudden economic shocks (like the collapse of tourism), a situation vastly different from Bangladesh's.

**My Comments and Conclusion:**

I concur with the experts' assessment. The "debt trap" narrative often oversimplifies a complex issue and overlooks the agency of the borrowing country. Bangladesh is not a passive recipient of Chinese loans; it is a strategic actor making calculated decisions based on its own national interests.

However, this does not mean there is room for complacency. To continue avoiding any risk of debt distress, Bangladesh must:
*   **Maintain rigorous project appraisal standards** to ensure all future infrastructure projects are economically and financially sound.
*   **Continue to diversify its sources of development finance** to avoid over-reliance on any single partner.
*   **Insist on transparency and open, competitive bidding** for all major infrastructure projects to ensure value for money.

By continuing its policy of prudence, diversification, and strategic project selection, Bangladesh is well-positioned to leverage the opportunities offered by the BRI to build much-needed infrastructure without compromising its long-term debt sustainability.

### **03. In recent times, the process of officially identifying so-called illegal Bangladeshis in the Indian state of Assam has started. In this context, prepare a policy brief for Bangladesh.**

**Policy Brief for the Government of Bangladesh**

**TO:** National Security Council, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh
**FROM:** Ministry of Foreign Affairs
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT: Diplomatic Strategy Regarding the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Related Issues in Assam, India**

**1. Executive Summary:**
The process undertaken by the Indian state of Assam to update its National Register of Citizens (NRC), which resulted in the exclusion of approximately 1.9 million people, presents a significant potential challenge to Bangladesh's national interests and bilateral relations with India. While India has repeatedly assured Bangladesh at the highest levels that this is an "internal matter," the risk remains that those excluded could be declared "stateless" and subsequently pushed towards Bangladesh. This brief outlines a proactive, multi-layered diplomatic strategy to pre-emptively manage this issue, protect our national interests, and maintain the stability of our crucial relationship with India.

**2. Problem Statement and Potential Risks:**

*   **The Core Issue:** The NRC process in Assam is aimed at identifying individuals who cannot prove their or their ancestors' presence in the state before midnight on March 24, 1971—the day before Bangladesh's declaration of independence.
*   **Potential Risks for Bangladesh:**
    1.  **Risk of Influx:** The primary risk is the potential for a large-scale, forced displacement of people declared "foreigners" into Bangladesh, creating a new humanitarian and security crisis.
    2.  **Strain on Bilateral Relations:** Any attempt to deport people to Bangladesh would severely damage the fabric of our historically strong and friendly relationship with India, which is the cornerstone of our foreign policy.
    3.  **Domestic and Regional Destabilization:** The issue could be exploited by domestic political groups for partisan gain and could create instability in the border region.

**3. Recommended Diplomatic Strategy and Actions:**

Our strategy must be firm in principle but quiet and persistent in execution, avoiding public confrontation while clearly communicating our position.

*   **Pillar 1: Consistent and High-Level Bilateral Engagement:**
    *   **Action:** Continue to engage with the Indian central government at the highest political and diplomatic levels (Prime Ministerial, Foreign Ministerial). We must consistently seek and secure reaffirmations of India's official position that the NRC is an internal matter and will have no consequences for Bangladesh.
    *   **Justification:** This locks India into a public and diplomatic commitment, making it much harder for them to reverse their position. It is our primary line of defense.

*   **Pillar 2: Maintain a Firm and Unwavering Legal Position:**
    *   **Action:** Our official position must be clear and unequivocal: **No illegal migration has taken place from Bangladesh to India after 1971.** The burden of proof lies entirely with the Indian authorities. We will not accept anyone who cannot be proven, with documentary evidence, to be a Bangladeshi citizen.
    *   **Justification:** This strong legal stance closes the door to any possibility of accepting deportees. It is a non-negotiable red line.

*   **Pillar 3: Quiet Diplomacy and Back-Channel Communication:**
    *   **Action:** Utilize back-channel and Track-II diplomacy involving academics, retired diplomats, and thought leaders to convey our concerns and explore cooperative solutions away from the media spotlight. We should sensitize influential political and civil society actors within India about the potential negative consequences of this issue for the broader bilateral relationship.
    *   **Justification:** This allows for candid discussions and helps manage perceptions within India, preventing the issue from being used for domestic political mobilization against Bangladesh.

*   **Pillar 4: Strengthen Border Management:**
    *   **Action:** While pursuing diplomacy, we must enhance surveillance and vigilance along the Assam border through the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) to prevent any potential "push-in" attempts by Indian border forces. Any such attempt must be documented and immediately raised through official diplomatic channels.
    *   **Justification:** This demonstrates our resolve and provides concrete evidence to counter any claims or actions on the ground.

**4. Conclusion:**
The NRC issue in Assam is a sensitive and potentially volatile one. Our strategy must be one of patient, persistent, and multi-layered diplomacy. By maintaining a firm legal position, securing continuous high-level assurances from New Delhi, and engaging in quiet diplomacy, we can effectively mitigate the risks to our national interests and ensure that this "internal matter" of India does not become an external problem for Bangladesh.
