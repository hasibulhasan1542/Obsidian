### 1. **Realism**

- **Explanation**: <font color="#9bbb59">Realism emphasizes the competitive and conflictual side of international relations, prioritizing state security and power above all else. </font>Realists argue that the international system is anarchic, meaning there is no central authority above states. As a result, states must rely on self-help to secure their interests, often leading to power struggles and wars. Realism focuses on national interest and power dynamics, with states acting rationally to maximize their survival.
- Prominent figures: Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz. 
- **Example**: The Cold War (1947-1991), where the U.S. and the Soviet Union competed for global dominance and security in an environment defined by mutual distrust and military power.

### 2. **Neo-liberalism**

- **Explanation**: Liberalism stresses the potential for cooperation in international relations and argues that international institutions, democracy, and trade promote peace and stability. <font color="#9bbb59">Liberals believe that while the international system is anarchic, institutions and interdependence can mitigate conflict. </font>The theory emphasizes human rights, environmental protection, and economic cooperation. Key proponents: John Locke, Robert Keohane.
    
**Example**: The creation of the European Union (EU) after World War II, where European countries came together to promote economic integration and prevent further conflicts.
### 3. **Constructivism**

- **Explanation**: <font color="#9bbb59">Constructivism argues that international relations are <u>shaped by social structures, ideas, and identities</u> rather than by material forces alone. </font>States' actions and interests are influenced by their perceptions and beliefs. This theory emphasizes the role of ideational factors, such as culture, religion, and historical narratives. Prominent theorists: Alexander Wendt, Nicholas Onuf.
    
**Example**: The end of the Cold War, where changes in the identities and beliefs of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, along with diplomatic efforts, contributed to the peaceful resolution of the conflict.
### 4. **Marxism**

- **Explanation**: Marxist theory focuses on<font color="#9bbb59"> <u>the economic dimensions of international relations</u>,</font> particularly how capitalist structures create global inequalities. Marxists argue that imperialism and exploitation are inherent to capitalism, leading to conflicts between the wealthy capitalist states and poorer countries. They believe the international system benefits the capitalist elite at the expense of the working class.
    
**Example**: The global inequality between the Global North (developed nations) and Global South (developing nations), often seen in trade relations where rich countries exploit resources from poorer ones.
### 5. **Feminist Theory**

- **Explanation**: Feminist international relations theory examines how gender influences global politics, often <font color="#ffff00">highlighting the role of women and the marginalization of gender minorities</font> in global systems. It critiques traditional theories for neglecting gender dynamics and calls for more inclusive perspectives in foreign policy and security discussions. Key figures: Cynthia Enloe, J. Ann Tickner.
    
**Example**: <u>The UN Security Councilâ€™s adoption of Resolution 1325 in 2000, which calls for the inclusion of women in peacebuilding processes and conflict resolution.</u>
### 6. **Critical Theory**

- **Explanation**: Critical theory challenges traditional international relations by focusing on power, social justice, and the historical conditions that shape international structures. It emphasizes <font color="#ffff00">the need for transformation rather than simply understanding the existing order</font>. Influenced by Marxism and postmodernism, critical theory seeks to expose inequalities and advocate for social change.
    
**Example**: The 1999 WTO protests in Seattle, where critics of globalization argued that international economic systems benefited the wealthy at the expense of the poor.
### 7. **Neorealism (Structural Realism)**

- **Explanation**: Neorealism builds on traditional realism but emphasizes <font color="#ffff00">the structure of the international system as the primary determinant of state behavior</font>. Kenneth Waltz argues that <font color="#ffff00">the anarchy of the international system forces states into power competition</font>. Unlike classical realism, neorealism focuses more on systemic factors rather than human nature as the cause of conflict.
    
**Example**: The arms race during the Cold War, where the U.S. and the Soviet Union competed in a nuclear buildup due to the anarchic nature of the international system.
### 8. **Neoliberal Institutionalism**

- **Explanation**: Neoliberal institutionalism stresses the importance of international institutions and cooperation among states. It argues that institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization help mitigate the anarchy of the international system by providing mechanisms for states to cooperate on shared interests like trade, environment, and security.
    
**Example**: The Paris Agreement (2015) on climate change, where nearly 200 countries came together to pledge action on reducing carbon emissions despite a lack of central enforcement mechanisms.
### 9. **World-System Theory**

- **Explanation**: Developed by Immanuel Wallerstein, world-system theory suggests that <font color="#ffff00">the world is divided into core, semi-peripheral, and peripheral nations, where core nations exploit peripheral ones for resources and labor.</font> This theory emphasizes economic inequalities and global capitalism's role in maintaining a hierarchical global order.
    
**Example**: The global trade system, where countries like the U.S. and China dominate the core, while countries in Africa or parts of Latin America are peripheral, often exporting raw materials to the core nations.
### 10. **Dependency Theory**

- **Explanation**: Dependency theory focuses on the ways in which <font color="#ffff00">developing countries are dependent on developed countries</font>. It argues that the economic development of rich countries often comes at the expense of poorer nations, which are trapped in a cycle of dependency that limits their ability to develop independently.
    
**Example**: The historical exploitation of Latin American countries by European colonial powers and the continued economic dependence of many former colonies on Western nations.
### 11. **Hegemonic Stability Theory**

- **Explanation**: This theory suggests that <font color="#ffff00">global order and stability are best maintained when a single, dominant power (hegemon) enforces the rules</font> of the international system. The hegemon provides public goods like security and stability that help prevent wars and promote global cooperation. Key proponent: Charles Kindleberger.
    
**Example**: The U.S. role after World War II in stabilizing the global order, promoting the Bretton Woods system, and maintaining peace through military dominance and economic influence.
### 12. **Post-Colonialism**

- **Explanation**: Post-colonial theory examines how <font color="#ffff00">the legacies of colonialism affect current international relations</font>. It highlights the exploitation and marginalization of the Global South by the West and calls for a reimagining of international power structures.

**Example**: The global environmental movement, where NGOs like Greenpeace and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) advocate for climate action at the international level.
### 15. **English School Theory (International Society Theory)**

- **Explanation**: The English School theory focuses on the idea of international society, where <font color="#ffff00">states share common interests, norms, and values despite the anarchical nature of the international system</font>. The theory seeks a middle ground between realism and liberalism by highlighting norms and institutions that govern state interactions.
    
**Example**: The United Nations system, where norms and principles such as sovereignty, non-intervention, and human rights are upheld by member states.
### 16. **Theory of Complex Interdependence**

- **Explanation**: This theory, developed by<font color="#ffff00"> Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye</font>, argues that in an interconnected world, states are increasingly dependent on each other across multiple issue areas (such as economics, environment, and security).

### 19. **Rational Choice Theory**

- **Explanation**: Rational choice theory posits that states act based on rational calculations, weighing the costs and benefits of their actions. <font color="#ffff00">In international relations, states make decisions that maximize their national interests</font>, particularly in terms of security and economic advantage.
    
**Example**: The U.S. decision to enter World War II, calculating that defeating Nazi Germany and Japan would serve its national security interests despite the costs of war.
### 20. **Environmental Security Theory**

- **Explanation**: Environmental security theory argues that environmental degradation, such as climate change, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss, is a key factor in international conflicts. It suggests that resource scarcity or ecological disasters can drive migration, competition for resources, and geopolitical tensions.
**Example**: Water scarcity in the Middle East, where countries like Syria and Iraq have faced tensions over access to the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, leading to regional conflicts.

    

### 22. **Liberal Internationalism**

- **Example**: The post-Cold War expansion of the European Union, where former Eastern Bloc countries were integrated into liberal democratic institutions, such as NATO and the EU.
    


### 24. **Mahanian Theory of Sea Power**

- **Explanation**: Proposed by Alfred Thayer Mahan, this theory emphasizes the <font color="#ffff00">importance of naval power and maritime trade routes to a nationâ€™s global influence and security</font>.
    
- **Example**: The U.S. Navyâ€™s dominance in the Pacific, particularly in the context of the ongoing U.S.-China maritime rivalry in the South China Sea.
    

### 25. **Balance of Power Theory**

- **Explanation**: This theory suggests that peace and <font color="#ffff00">stability in international relations are best maintained when power is distributed roughly equally among competing states or alliances</font>.
    
- **Example**: The Cold War balance of power between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, where both superpowers maintained nuclear arsenals to prevent war through the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD).

> [!tip]
> This is the opposite of Hegemony Theory


### 26. **Sovereignty Theory**

- **Explanation**: Sovereignty theory emphasizes the principle of state sovereignty as central to the international system, advocating that states should have control over their domestic affairs without external interference.
    
- **Example**: The principle of non-intervention in the Syrian Civil War, where Russia and China opposed foreign intervention, emphasizing Syria's sovereignty.
    

### 27. **Theories of Imperialism**

- **Explanation**: Imperialism theories suggest that powerful states or empires dominate and exploit weaker regions for economic, political, or cultural gain, often justifying it through a civilizing mission or strategic interests.
    
- **Example**: The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was justified by the U.S. government as a move to bring democracy and stability, but critics argue it was an imperialist action for control of oil resources.
    

### 29. **Deterrence Theory**

- **Explanation**: Deterrence theory suggests that the threat of overwhelming retaliation can prevent aggressive actions by states or non-state actors.
    
- **Example**: The U.S.'s nuclear deterrence strategy during the Cold War, where the threat of nuclear retaliation deterred Soviet aggression.
    

### 30. **Power Transition Theory**

- **Explanation**: This theory argues that <font color="#ffff00">conflicts arise when a rising power threatens to surpass a dominant power,</font> challenging the existing global order.
    
- **Example**: The growing tensions between the U.S. and China, as Chinaâ€™s rapid economic growth challenges U.S. dominance in global politics.


### 37. **Security Dilemma**

- **Explanation**: The security dilemma occurs <font color="#ffff00">when one state's efforts to increase its security (such as building up its military) cause insecurity in other states, leading to an arms race or conflict</font>.
    
- **Example**: The U.S. missile defense systems in Europe, which were seen by Russia as a threat, increasing military tensions.
    

### 38. **Cosmopolitanism**

- **Explanation**: Cosmopolitanism argues that all human beings belong to a single community and that international relations should prioritize global justice and human rights, regardless of national borders.
    
- **Example**: The global movement for refugee rights, where various international actors call for the protection of individuals fleeing war and persecution, regardless of their country of origin.

### 45. **Soft Power**

- **Explanation**: Soft power is the <font color="#ffff00">ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction, rather than coercion, often through culture, diplomacy, or values</font>.
    
- **Example**: The U.S.'s cultural export through Hollywood movies and popular culture, which has helped shape global perceptions of American values and influence.

- **Example**: The global response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa (2014-2016), which saw international health organizations collaborate to curb the spread.
    

### 53. **Neoclassical Realism**

- **Explanation**: Neoclassical realism incorporates domestic political factors into traditional realism, suggesting that state behavior is influenced not only by international power dynamics but also by internal issues such as regime type, elite interests, and national identity.
    
- **Example**: The foreign policy decisions of the U.S. under President George W. Bush in the 2000s, which were influenced by domestic political considerations like the War on Terror.
    
### 67. **Neo-Gramscianism**

- **Explanation**: Neo-Gramscianism extends Antonio Gramsciâ€™s theory of hegemony to the international level, suggesting that <font color="#ffff00">global power structures are maintained through ideologies and economic dominance rather than force</font>.
    
- **Example**: The role of the United States in maintaining global capitalist order through institutions like the IMF and World Bank, which promote neoliberal economic policies.
    

### 68. **Revolutionary Theory of International Relations**

- **Explanation**: This theory argues that international relations are often shaped by revolutions and the overthrow of established regimes, which bring about new power structures.
    
- **Example**: The Cuban Revolution of 1959, which had significant geopolitical consequences, influencing U.S. foreign policy in Latin America during the Cold War.
    

### 69. **Transnationalism**

- **Explanation**: Transnationalism highlights the role of non-state actors, such as multinational corporations, NGOs, and diasporas, in shaping international relations and global governance.
    
- **Example**: The role of multinational corporations like Apple and Google, which influence global trade, data privacy laws, and international regulations through their global presence.
    

### 70. **Theory of Global Economic Governance**

- **Explanation**: This theory explores the role of international financial institutions, such as the IMF, World Bank, and WTO, in shaping global economic policies and managing international economic crises.
    
- **Example**: The IMFâ€™s involvement in managing Greece's debt crisis, which included imposing austerity measures in exchange for bailout packages.

- **Example**: The International Labour Organization (ILO), which works to set international labor standards and protect workersâ€™ rights worldwide.
    

### 80. **Resource Diplomacy**

- **Explanation**: Resource diplomacy focuses on how the control, access, and management of natural resources influence international relations and global power structures.
    
- **Example**: The strategic importance of the Arctic, where countries like Russia, Canada, and the U.S. have competing interests in the regionâ€™s natural resources, including oil and gas.

### 81. **Hegemonic Stability Theory**

- **Explanation**: This theory suggests that international stability is more likely when a single nation, the hegemon, dominates global politics and provides public goods like security, trade, and economic stability.
    
- **Example**: The United States post-World War II is often cited as a hegemon, maintaining stability in the global order through institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and NATO.
    

### 82. **Intergovernmentalism**

- **Explanation**: This theory in international relations posits that decisions in international organizations are primarily made by sovereign states rather than international institutions or actors.
    
- **Example**: The European Unionâ€™s decision-making process, particularly in areas like foreign policy, where the European Council, composed of member-state leaders, plays a key role.

### 100. **Environmental Security Theory**

- **Explanation**: Environmental security theory examines how environmental issues, such as resource scarcity, climate change, and ecological degradation, can lead to conflict and affect national and global security.
    
- **Example**: The water scarcity issue in the Nile Basin, where competition for water resources between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia has the potential to escalate into conflict.

### 101. **Zero-Sum Game Theory**

- **Explanation**: Zero-sum game theory is a concept in which one playerâ€™s gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of other players. In a zero-sum game, the total benefit or value remains constant, and one participantâ€™s success comes at the expense of another.
    
- **Example**: **International trade negotiations**â€”where a countryâ€™s trade surplus might be a direct result of another countryâ€™s trade deficit. If one country benefits from a trade deal, the other must lose, often seen in traditional protectionist trade policies.
    

### 102. **Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma**

- **Explanation**: The Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma is a classic example from game theory where two individuals acting in their own self-interest may not produce the optimal outcome for both. It shows how rational behavior can lead to a worse result when both sides fail to cooperate.
    
- **Example**: **Nuclear arms race**â€”During the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union faced a dilemma: while both countries would be safer if they agreed to limit nuclear weapons, both feared that the other would cheat, leading them to continue building arsenals, thus escalating the arms race.
    

### 103. **Win-Win Game Theory**

- **Explanation**: Win-win or non-zero-sum game theory is the opposite of zero-sum. It refers to scenarios in which all participants can benefit from cooperation. The key is finding solutions or agreements where both sides gain rather than one sideâ€™s gain coming at the expense of the other.
    
- **Example**: **Environmental agreements**â€”Countries cooperating on global climate change treaties can benefit mutually by sharing technologies, reducing emissions, and protecting ecosystems. The Paris Agreement is an example of a win-win scenario where both developed and developing nations work together toward a common goal.
    

### 104. **Chicken Game (or Game of Chicken)**

- **Explanation**: The Chicken Game is a game theory model of conflict where two players head toward each other and must choose whether to swerve or continue. If neither swerves, both will "crash." The goal is to force the other side to back down to avoid mutual destruction, but both sides must calculate the otherâ€™s potential response.
    
- **Example**: **Cold War brinkmanship**â€”During the Cuban Missile Crisis, both the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a Chicken Game, each pushing the other to the brink of nuclear war while avoiding direct conflict.
    

### 105. **Tit-for-Tat Strategy**

- **Explanation**: This strategy involves cooperating initially, and then replicating the opponentâ€™s previous move in subsequent rounds. Itâ€™s a strategy often used in repeated games where participants learn from one anotherâ€™s behavior over time, rewarding cooperation and punishing betrayal.
    
- **Example**: **Diplomatic negotiations**, like trade talks, where if one country shows cooperation by reducing tariffs, the other reciprocates in kind. The World Trade Organization (WTO) often uses this kind of approach in trade negotiations to encourage reciprocal benefits.
    

### 106. **Coase Theorem**

- **Explanation**: The Coase Theorem suggests that under conditions of no transaction costs and well-defined property rights, parties will negotiate to correct externalities, achieving an efficient outcome, regardless of initial allocations.
    
- **Example**: **Environmental regulation**â€”If two neighboring countries are polluting shared resources, the Coase theorem would suggest they could negotiate a solution, such as a mutual agreement to reduce emissions, without government intervention, provided they have clear rights to the resources.
    

### 107. **Nash Equilibrium**

- **Explanation**: The Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player in a game can improve their situation by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the others. In other words, itâ€™s a state where every participantâ€™s strategy is optimal given the choices of others.
    
- **Example**: **Arms control treaties**, where countries reach a stable state of arms reduction where no one wants to increase their arsenal due to the assurance that other countries have also reduced theirs, as seen in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).
    

### 108. **Collective Action Problem**

- **Explanation**: This theory addresses situations where individual actors' rational pursuit of self-interest leads to suboptimal outcomes for all parties involved. It often requires coordination to achieve a desirable collective outcome.
    
- **Example**: **Global climate change**â€”Each country may prefer to free-ride on the efforts of others to reduce emissions, but unless all contribute, no one will achieve a sustainable outcome. International frameworks like the Paris Climate Accord are efforts to overcome this challenge.
    

### 109. **Hegemonic Stability Theory**

- **Explanation**: Hegemonic Stability Theory posits that international order and stability are more likely when one dominant power, or hegemon, enforces rules and provides global public goods. The hegemon plays a stabilizing role in global politics.
    
- **Example**: **Post-World War II international order**â€”The United States acted as a hegemon, helping create international institutions like the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank, stabilizing global politics.
    

### 110. **Path Dependency Theory**

- **Explanation**: Path dependency suggests that historical decisions influence present and future policies, making some policies more likely to continue than others due to past institutional decisions or established practices.
    
- **Example**: **European integration**â€”The initial steps taken toward European unity after World War II, such as the European Coal and Steel Community, led to the European Union, with policies of cooperation becoming increasingly difficult to change due to their historical development.

### 111. **The Tragedy of the Commons**

- **Explanation**: This theory explains how individuals, acting in their own self-interest, can overuse and deplete a shared resource, even when it is clear that this is detrimental to the group as a whole.
    
- **Example**: **Overfishing**â€”Countries exploiting international fishing waters for their own benefit may deplete fish stocks, harming future generations and the global ecosystem. International agreements, like the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, attempt to address this.
    

### 112. **Security Dilemma**

- **Explanation**: The security dilemma occurs when one stateâ€™s efforts to increase its security (such as building up its military) cause other states to feel less secure, prompting them to also increase their military power. This can lead to an arms race and increased tension.
    
- **Example**: **U.S. and China**â€”Chinaâ€™s military buildup has caused concern in the United States and its allies, leading to a security dilemma where the U.S. has increased its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region, further escalating tensions.
    

### 113. **Soft Power**

- **Explanation**: Soft power refers to the ability to shape global outcomes through non-coercive means, such as cultural influence, diplomacy, or ideological appeal, as opposed to military or economic power (hard power).
    
- **Example**: **U.S. cultural diplomacy**â€”Hollywood movies, Silicon Valley innovations, and academic institutions like Harvard help the United States shape global perceptions, making it a soft power player in world politics.
    

### 114. **Hard Power**

- **Explanation**: Hard power is the use of force or economic influence to achieve international objectives. It typically involves military or economic coercion, rather than persuasion or cultural influence.
    
- **Example**: **U.S. military interventions**â€”The U.S. use of military force in Iraq in 2003 or its sanctions on Iran are examples of hard power strategies, attempting to influence global outcomes through force or coercion.
    

### 115. **Balance of Power**

- **Explanation**: The balance of power theory suggests that national security is enhanced when military capabilities are distributed so that no one nation is strong enough to dominate all others. States may form alliances to prevent any single state from becoming too powerful.
    
- **Example**: **NATO and the Soviet Union**â€”During the Cold War, the balance of power between the U.S. and the Soviet Union kept the global peace. NATO was formed as a counterbalance to the Warsaw Pact, ensuring neither side could dominate Europe.
    

### 116. **Peaceful Coexistence**

- **Explanation**: Peaceful coexistence is the theory that countries with fundamentally different ideologies (like capitalism and socialism) can exist peacefully without direct military confrontation, as long as both sides respect each otherâ€™s sovereignty and avoid interference.
    
- **Example**: **U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War**â€”Despite ideological differences, the concept of peaceful coexistence was a key feature of detente, where both superpowers worked to avoid direct military conflict while competing in other areas like space exploration.
    

### 117. **Realpolitik**

- **Explanation**: Realpolitik focuses on practical and pragmatic policies rather than ideological or ethical considerations. It emphasizes power, national interests, and the use of diplomacy or force to achieve those goals, often at the expense of idealism.
    
- **Example**: **Germanyâ€™s foreign policy under Otto von Bismarck**â€”Bismarckâ€™s approach was grounded in realpolitik, prioritizing the interests of the German state over ideological concerns and shaping Europeâ€™s power balance.
    

### 118. **Democratic Peace Theory**

- **Explanation**: Democratic peace theory suggests that democracies are less likely to go to war with one another because they share similar norms and institutional checks on the use of military force.
    
- **Example**: **EU member states**â€”European Union members are all democracies and have not gone to war with each other since the formation of the EU. The EUâ€™s promotion of democracy and economic interdependence is seen as a key factor in this stability.
    

### 119. **World-System Theory**

- **Explanation**: Developed by sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein, this theory suggests that the global economy is a complex system with a core of wealthy, industrialized nations, a semi-periphery of developing nations, and a periphery of impoverished, resource-exporting countries.
    
- **Example**: **Global North-South Divide**â€”The disparity in wealth and development between wealthy countries (like the U.S. and Western Europe) and poorer nations (like many African countries) is a practical application of world-system theory.
    

### 120. **World Order Theory**

- **Explanation**: World order theory concerns the global distribution of power and how it affects international stability. The theory suggests that world order is often shaped by the distribution of power, and new power dynamics can create shifts in how the world functions.
    
- **Example**: **Rise of China**â€”As China rises as a global power, it is challenging the existing world order dominated by the U.S. The shifting balance of power has led to new international relationships and institutions, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
    

### 121. **Constructivism in International Relations**

- **Explanation**: Constructivism posits that international relations are shaped by social structures, ideas, norms, and identities, rather than solely material forces like military and economic power. State behavior is influenced by these norms, which evolve over time.
    
- **Example**: **Post-Cold War norms**â€”The shift in global norms after the end of the Cold War led to greater acceptance of human rights and democracy, seen in the expansion of the EU and NATO.
    

### 122. **Dependency Theory**

- **Explanation**: Dependency theory argues that the economic conditions of the Global South (developing countries) are shaped by their dependence on developed countries, which exploit their resources and perpetuate inequality.
    
- **Example**: **Latin American countries**â€”Historically, Latin American nations have been economically dependent on exports of raw materials to developed countries, leaving them vulnerable to global market shifts and perpetuating cycles of poverty.
    

### 123. **Liberation Theory**

- **Explanation**: Liberation theory advocates for the political and economic freedom of oppressed groups, often in the context of post-colonial struggles. It emphasizes self-determination and the redistribution of power to marginalized communities.
    
- **Example**: **South Africaâ€™s struggle for independence**â€”Under apartheid, liberation movements like the African National Congress (ANC) fought for the freedom of Black South Africans, eventually leading to democratic elections in 1994.
    

### 124. **Economic Imperialism**

- **Explanation**: Economic imperialism refers to the domination of a less-developed country by a more-developed country through economic means rather than direct military control, often by controlling trade, resources, or investment.
    
- **Example**: **British colonialism in India**â€”The British Empire exerted control over Indiaâ€™s resources, using its economic leverage to shape the countryâ€™s economic and political structures, benefiting Britain at Indiaâ€™s expense.
    

### 125. **Cultural Imperialism**

- **Explanation**: Cultural imperialism refers to the imposition of a dominant culture over others, often by powerful nations exerting influence through media, entertainment, language, and education.
    
- **Example**: **Hollywood and global media**â€”The export of American films, television shows, and music has been seen as a form of cultural imperialism, influencing values and cultural norms worldwide, especially in post-colonial countries.
