### 🌍 International Organizations

**1. Describe the veto power of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. – 44th**

The five permanent members (P5) of the UN Security Council—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—possess veto power, allowing them to block any substantive resolution. This means that if any one of these members casts a negative vote, the resolution fails, regardless of the number of affirmative votes. The veto does not apply to procedural matters. Since its inception, the veto has been used to protect national interests, uphold foreign policy principles, or address issues of particular importance to a member state. For instance, the USSR cast the first veto in 1946 concerning the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Syria . As of recent records, the veto has been exercised over 290 times. Critics argue that the veto power can hinder the Council's ability to act decisively in crises. However, proponents believe it ensures that the interests of major powers are considered, maintaining international stability. The veto remains a central feature of the Security Council's decision-making process. Efforts to reform or limit its use have been discussed but have not led to significant changes.​[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Security Council Report+1Wikipedia+1](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-security-council-working-methods/the-veto.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**4. What is the dispute settlement mechanism in the WTO? – 40th**

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a structured dispute settlement mechanism to ensure that trade flows smoothly and predictably. When member countries believe that their rights under WTO agreements are being infringed upon, they can bring disputes to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The process begins with consultations between the parties to resolve the issue amicably. If consultations fail, the complainant can request the establishment of a panel to examine the case. The panel's findings can be appealed to the Appellate Body, which reviews legal aspects of the case . Once the reports are adopted, the losing party is expected to comply with the rulings. If compliance is not achieved, the complaining party may seek authorization to impose trade sanctions. This mechanism ensures that disputes are resolved based on agreed legal principles, maintaining the integrity of the multilateral trading system. The system is unique in international law for its automaticity and enforceability. It has been instrumental in resolving numerous trade disputes since the WTO's inception.​[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispute_settlement_in_the_World_Trade_Organization?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c6s1p1_e.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 1. What is the Responsibility to Protect (R2P)?

The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is an international norm adopted by all UN member states at the 2005 World Summit. It obligates states to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. If a state fails in this duty, the international community is prepared to take collective action, including diplomatic, humanitarian, and, if necessary, military measures. R2P emerged in response to the international community's failure to prevent atrocities in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. It redefines sovereignty as a responsibility, emphasizing that the protection of civilians is paramount. <span style="color: #DA70D6">The principle is detailed in paragraphs 138–139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document. </span> R2P has been invoked in various international crises to justify intervention aimed at preventing mass atrocities. However, its implementation remains subject to political will and consensus among international actors. The doctrine continues to influence debates on humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty. ​[Wikipedia+1United Nations+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Global Centre for R2P+4United Nations+4Wikipedia+4](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/responsibility-protect?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Global Centre for R2P](https://www.globalr2p.org/what-is-r2p/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[UNA-UK](https://una.org.uk/r2p-detail?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 2. Briefly mention the significance of CEDAW.

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), adopted by the UN in 1979, is often referred to as the international bill of rights for women. It defines what constitutes discrimination against women and sets up an agenda for national action to end such discrimination. CEDAW obligates states to incorporate the principle of equality into their legal systems and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women by persons, organizations, or enterprises. It addresses areas such as education, employment, health care, and family relations. The Convention is unique in that it affirms women's reproductive rights and targets culture and tradition as influential forces shaping gender roles and family relations. With 189 state parties, CEDAW has near-universal ratification, reflecting a global commitment to gender equality. It serves as a critical tool for advocacy and legal reform worldwide. CEDAW's monitoring body, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, reviews progress and provides recommendations to states. The Convention has significantly influenced national laws and policies promoting women's rights. Its implementation continues to be a focal point in the global struggle for gender equality. ​[OHCHR+2UN Women+2Wikipedia+2](https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2016/12/cedaw-for-youth?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[United Nations](https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/cedaw.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3. What is an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) according to international maritime law?

An Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a sea zone prescribed by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), extending up to 200 nautical miles from a state's coastal baseline. Within this zone, a coastal state has sovereign rights for exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing natural resources, both living and non-living, of the waters above the seabed and of the seabed and its subsoil. The state also has jurisdiction over artificial islands, marine scientific research, and the protection and preservation of the marine environment. While the coastal state has exclusive rights to the resources, other states have freedoms of navigation and overflight, subject to the regulation of the coastal state. The EEZ concept balances the interests of coastal states in resource utilization with the rights of other states in maritime navigation. It has become a central element in maritime boundary delimitation and resource management. Disputes over EEZ boundaries are common, especially in regions with overlapping claims. UNCLOS provides mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of such disputes. The EEZ regime has significantly expanded the maritime jurisdiction of coastal states. It plays a crucial role in global fisheries management and marine conservation efforts. ​[NOAA+1Wikipedia+1](https://www.noaa.gov/maritime-zones-and-boundaries?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Tufts Self-Serve Blogs+1Encyclopedia Britannica+1](https://sites.tufts.edu/lawofthesea/chapter-two/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/exclusive-economic-zone?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 4. What are the Bretton Woods Institutions?

The Bretton Woods Institutions refer to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, established in July 1944 during the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA. The IMF was created to promote international monetary cooperation, facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade, and provide resources to member countries facing balance of payments problems. The World Bank's initial purpose was to finance the reconstruction of war-torn Europe; it later shifted focus to development projects in emerging economies. Both institutions aim to ensure global financial stability and economic development. They provide financial assistance, policy advice, and technical support to member countries. The Bretton Woods system also introduced fixed exchange rates, with currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, which was convertible to gold. This system collapsed in the early 1970s, leading to floating exchange rates. Despite this, the IMF and World Bank continue to play pivotal roles in the global economic system. They have evolved to address contemporary challenges, including poverty reduction and sustainable development. Their policies and programs significantly influence the economic strategies of developing countries. ​[Bretton Woods Project+1UN ESCWA+1](https://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2019/01/art-320747/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The IMF has three critical missions: 
- furthering international monetary cooperation
- encouraging the expansion of trade and economic growth
- discouraging policies that would harm prosperity. 
### 1. Explain the main causes of the Arab Spring. – 45th

The Arab Spring, beginning in late 2010, was driven by widespread dissatisfaction with authoritarian regimes, economic hardship, and social injustices in the Middle East and North Africa. Key factors included high unemployment rates, especially among youth, rampant government corruption, lack of political freedoms, and human rights abuses. The self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor protesting police harassment, became a catalyst for mass protests. Social media platforms played a crucial role in mobilizing protesters and disseminating information. The movement led to the overthrow of leaders in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen, while sparking unrest in other countries.

### 5. What is cyber terrorism? – 43rd

Cyber terrorism refers to the use of computer networks to conduct attacks that cause or threaten significant harm, aiming to intimidate or coerce governments or societies for political or ideological objectives. Such attacks may target critical infrastructure, such as power grids, financial systems, or communication networks, leading to widespread disruption. Unlike traditional cybercrime, cyber terrorism is characterized by its intent to instill fear and achieve broader political goals. The anonymity and global reach of cyberspace make it an attractive domain for terrorist activities. ​[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Mention the characteristics of international terrorism. – 41st, 40th

International terrorism involves acts of violence intended to cause fear across borders, typically for ideological, political, or religious purposes. It is marked by asymmetry, where non-state actors use unconventional tactics like bombings or cyber-attacks to challenge state power. Such terrorism often targets civilians, infrastructure, or symbols of authority. It operates through decentralized networks, making detection and prevention difficult. Terrorist groups exploit global communication platforms for propaganda and recruitment. Funding often comes from illicit trades, extortion, or online fundraising. The international nature of these acts complicates jurisdiction and response. Global cooperation, intelligence sharing, and legal frameworks are essential to addressing this threat.

### What is meant by human rights violations? Give examples. – 38th

Human rights violations occur when basic freedoms and protections — such as life, liberty, and security — are infringed by states, organizations, or individuals. Common violations include torture, arbitrary arrests, suppression of free speech, and discrimination based on race, religion, or gender. In conflict zones, attacks on civilians or denial of humanitarian access constitute grave breaches of international law. For example, the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and state surveillance of minority groups in China are widely cited. Violations can be systemic or isolated and may result in international investigations or sanctions. Institutions like the UN Human Rights Council, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch monitor and report such abuses. Preventing violations is central to international law and global justice efforts.

### 5. **What is multilateralism? Why has it gained importance in today’s global order? – 44th**

Multilateralism is the process by which multiple countries work together on a given issue, adhering to agreed-upon norms and principles. It involves collaboration through international institutions and agreements to address global challenges. Multilateralism has gained importance due to the interconnected nature of issues like climate change, pandemics, and terrorism. No single nation can effectively tackle these problems alone, necessitating collective action. It promotes shared responsibility, legitimacy, and the pooling of resources. Multilateral frameworks facilitate dialogue, reduce conflicts, and enhance global stability. They also provide platforms for smaller nations to have a voice in international affairs. In an era of globalization, multilateralism ensures coordinated responses to transnational issues. It strengthens international norms and fosters cooperation among diverse actors. Overall, multilateralism is essential for maintaining a rules-based international order. ​

### 1. **What is soft power? – 44th, 37th**

<span style="color: #DA70D6">Soft power is a country's ability to influence others through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion or payment. </span> Coined by political scientist Joseph Nye, it encompasses cultural appeal, political values, and foreign policies that are seen as legitimate or having moral authority. Soft power enables nations to shape the preferences of others, fostering cooperation and goodwill. Examples include promoting cultural exports, educational exchanges, and diplomatic initiatives that align with global norms. In the modern era, soft power is a critical component of international relations, complementing traditional hard power strategies. ​[Nature+2Harvard Kennedy School+2SPF USA+2](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/soft-power-and-public-diplomacy-revisited?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/63df699a-efdb-4613-b070-80a763ec024e?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 1. Difference Between Concessional and Non-Concessional Loans

Concessional loans are extended on more favorable terms than market loans, typically featuring lower interest rates, longer repayment periods, and grace periods. These loans are often provided by international financial institutions like the World Bank to support development projects in low-income countries. For instance, Bangladesh receives concessional loans from the World Bank for infrastructure development. [Economic Relations Division](https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/9d765e3d_3750_4746_a536_3c50755b7450/Definition.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)​
